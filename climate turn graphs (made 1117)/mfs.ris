AB  - This essay reflects on the challenges posed to cultural and fiction studies by cases of imperially sedimented inter-positionality: their repercussions on our understanding of lived temporalities, the strategies we use to translate this understanding into art, and the critical tools to evaluate artworks thus produced. The essay makes operational the category of inter-imperiality and tackles phenomena such as placedness, translatability, and futurity of artwork, while discussing the Yugoslav surrealists’ piece of engagement art Facing a Wall: A Simulation of the Paranoiac Delirium of Interpretation. Survey (1932), Vane Bor’s 1935 photo-series, and Marko Ristić’s 1928 anti-novel Without Measure (1928).

AB  - Neoliberal discourses of globalization frequently emphasise a temporal break in history, a paradigm shift at once irreversible and comprehensible only on its own terms. This essay, conversely, uses an inter-imperial framework to evaluate neoliberalism as a variant among several capitalist practices. Bringing together Wang Gang’s novel English (2004) and J. M. Coetzee’s Waiting for the Barbarians (1980), it highlights the ways in which the ruins of language and infrastructures continue to inscribe the present tense. It also shows how the Silk Road, a nineteenth-century colonial construct, encapsulates China’s dreams of global trade and prosperity in a neoliberal era.

AB  - Korean culture is a paradigmatic case for studying inter-imperial dynamics as the country’s history has been shaped by the interplay of four competing empires: China, Japan, Russia, and the US. This essay examines Korean diasporic literature and argues, first, that understanding a colonial author’s inter-imperial positionality allows texts to be reinterpreted in light of the matrix of competing forces in the inter-imperial sphere. Second, the essay looks at the distinctive Korean concept of han as a product of the nation’s inter-imperial history to consider how this aesthetic tradition continues to be a hallmark of contemporary diasporic fiction.

KW  - imperialism
AB  - This introduction outlines the theory and method of inter-imperiality, then highlights four threads running through this special issue: the longue durée imensions of literary-political history shaped by interacting and successive empires; the understudied philosophies and aesthetics of communities that have endured successive colonizations; the sedimentation of language politics in inter-imperial zones; and, in these contexts, the intertwining of economics with cultural and state formations. This introduction sets the stage for essays on diverse authors, hailing from different hemispheres and imagining in Turkic, Slavic, Arabic, Farsi, Indonesian, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, as well as in French and English.

AB  - Calling for a historiographical shift in literary criticism, this essay stresses the expansionist vision of the nineteenth-century Ottoman Empire, approaches its literature as a corpus of representation for imperial subjectivities, and thereby supplements the critique of the narrative of literary modernity identified with the orientalist E. J. W. Gibb. This essay argues that the tension between imperial expansionism and national indigenization constitutes a shaping force in Turkish literary modernity, urging scholars to investigate how the epistemology of the empire–influenced by the inter-imperial landscape of the nineteenth century–infiltrates the modern national literature and politics of Turkey.

AB  - In W. E. B. Du Bois’ Dark Princess (1928) Anglophone legibility simultaneously limits and extends coalitions between racialized subjects from different empires. Drawing on the concept of inter-imperiality, this essay argues that this novel is a key text for theorizing the connections between the emergent field of the Global Anglophone and earlier articulations of an inter-imperial English-speaking world that mediated relations among anti-colonial writers and activists as well as imperialists.

AB  - This essay investigates the implications of employing an inter-imperial heuristic within a longue durée timeframe for the study of postindependence Indonesian literature. It traces the history of shadow puppet theatre as a production of and vehicle for the politics of consecutive and contemporaneous empires in the Indonesian archipelago since the first millennium. Through a reading of Pramoedya Ananta Toer’s The Fugitive (1950), this essay argues that the transmediation from theatre to text of this centuriesold performative tradition afforded post-1945 authors a symbolic solution for managing the legacies of their nation’s imperialistic encounters in their pursuit of an emancipatory cultural project.

AB  - This essay inquires into the significance of the absent category of Japanophone literature in light of the recent rise of a global discourse on Sinophone literature and other postcolonial critical genealogies. This discussion of broader postcolonial taxonomies sets the stage for an investigation into the position of Japan as a minor empire in relation to its European counterparts. The precarious location among divided literary fields of colonial Korean writers, such as Kim Saryang, provides a segue into linking contested postcolonial and cold war legacies in the Asia-Pacific.

AB  - As yet, little research has been done on the literary treatment of borders, an issue gaining increasing coverage in fiction worldwide. Drawing on the work of Emily Hicks, Johan Schimanski, and Stephen Wolfe, as well as on the wider insights of Border Studies, this essay analyzes the discussion of borders in post-1945 fiction on Europe. Specifically, the essay focuses on the three interrelated concerns—physical borders, bordered identities and cross-border relations—that have dominated the study of geopolitical boundaries in Europe and elsewhere. The material under study includes work by Vladimir Lorchenkov, Herta Müller, Mahi Binebine, Ágota Kristóf, and Miroslav Penkov.

AB  - This essay takes up Toni Morrison's novel A Mercy to explore the connection between the Euro-American trope of wilderness and colonial practices of interpretation. By deploying the multilayered trope of wilderness, A Mercyhighlights the way colonial epistemology is deeply embedded in conventional Euro-American ways of reading—whether the text be written document, land, or human body—that rely on notions of discrete selfhood, linear history, abstract logic, and the elimination of ambiguity. Through this same trope, the novel ultimately unsettles the colonized territory of the reading process, offering a mode of reading that ruptures colonial interpretation.

AB  - David Evans summarizes a common critical response to Faulkner's The Hamlet, describing the novel as 'an allegory of modernization and its social and cultural consequences.' This essay claims that Faulkner's Frenchman's Bend fictions—The Hamlet, Father Abraham, and 'Barn Burning'—assert a largely unremarked source for modernization: the rural countryside. By tracing the modernizing energies of turn-of-the-century rural populism and its politics of rage, as well as the economic and cultural abstractions of rural capital, on display in these texts, this essay argues that they reverse a familiar trajectory in which modernity fans outland from distinctly urban environs.

AB  - This essay argues that Lawrence's tropes of wireless connection reflect his pursuit of a politics of non-sovereignty in the second half of his career. Frequently overshadowed by violent claims to sovereignty or by the celebration of the immediacy of touch, wireless connections stand for a minor utopianism of affective receptivity. Countering the hegemony of broadcasting as well as the sovereign claims of his own supposed leader characters, Lawrence conceived of the novel as a wireless medium in its own right, attuned to affective energies that can enable an impersonal intimacy among dispersed individuals and their nonhuman environment.

AB  - Evelyn Waugh’s Brideshead Revisited is among the most important and influential Catholic novels in the English language. It is also one of the queerest novels of its time. This essay explores the diverse ways in which Waugh’s novel traverses the apparent divisions that separate Catholic and queer sexuality. Drawing on archival research and recent theoretical and theological insights regarding celibacy, it argues that Brideshead participates in the aesthetic of fin de siècle British Decadence as a means of driving its central characters toward a form of sexuality that is at once potentially orthodox and queer.

AB  - V. S. Naipaul's novel The Enigma of Arrival revolves around peripatetic explorations of an England in decay. Saturated in pensive sadness, the novel has been read often as nostalgic for the time of empire. Against such views, this article reconsiders Enigma'saffective strategies by illuminating how it appropriates a romantic imaginary of walking among ruins and re-posits it in postcolonial context. The article demonstrates how Enigma's romanticist sadness and embodied engagement with place perform a critical revision of idealized fantasies of England and its imperial history.

AB  - Leviathan and The Virgin Suicides aestheticize the contradictory politics that Ronald Reagan laid forth in his presidency. With their representations of paradoxical events and the shared desire of their characters to simultaneously construct two (or more) mutually exclusive narratives of historical events, these novels depict interpretive acts in a liminal aesthetics that draws on both modernist and postmodernist techniques. The synthesis of such techniques challenges critical understandings of the aesthetic and political distinctions between modernism and postmodernism.

AB  - Atonement's depiction of the anachronistic English country house contravenes suppositions that similar spaces nostalgically commemorate an oppressive history. The novel instead explores the house as a historical fiction that continues to structure contemporary English culture. It exposes the way 'New Britain' both erases and reproduces many of the more pernicious aspects of English history, commodifying and revising history in much the same way that English Heritage has been accused of doing. The novel reopens the country house as a space that demands both a historical double take and skepticism toward preemptive celebrations of social progress.

AB  - This article asks whether and how enthusiasm can be read as a formal feature of texts and literary institutions in the contemporary period, as well as how enthusiasm produces literary value. I approach this question through an examination of Ali Smith's writing across genres, her reception in the context of literary prizes, and her curatorial work at literary festivals. This analysis pays particular attention to the tone and function of citation, arguing that what is cited and how are both significant. The article thus shows the ways in which enthusiasm is linked to the circular endorsement of literary value.

AB  - Critical opinion is largely united in seeing D. H. Lawrence's novel The Plumed Serpent as a strange and troubling work, offering a puzzling synthesis of primitivism, idealized masculinity, and authoritarian politics. However, there has been little attempt to grapple with the book's Mexican setting beyond its function as site of cultural exoticism. This article argues that the cultural projects of Mexican revolutionary nationalism in the 1920s provided a key impetus for the utopian thought experiments of The Plumed Serpent. Specifically, the article contends that contemporary Mexican debates around indigenousness were absorbed by Lawrence as he prepared the novel.

AB  - Edith Wharton and popular romance novelist Mary Roberts Rinehart, though not often studied together, are connected by striking plot similarities in their post-World War I novels, each of which draws on its author's journalistic expeditions to the front lines and highlights her fierce support for the Allies. Wharton's and Rinehart's shared pro-war politics fit uneasily into the canon of postwar literature, but these works merit further study because their complex treatment of soldier characters' sexuality challenges presumed narratives about female ignorance and male sexual libertinism during war and anticipates a modernist focus on the body as a locus of political meaning.

AB  - This essay reads Virginia Woolf's Between the Acts (1941) alongside the relatively underread genre of invasion fiction. Following modernist studies' recent turn toward interwar Britain's cultural anticipation of catastrophe, the essay foregrounds how Woolf's assumption of an imminent German invasion pervades her final novel. Juxtaposing Woolf's invasion motif with invasion literature reveals a shared skepticism toward English liberalism. Reading Acts in light of invasion clarifies Woolf's suspicion that liberalism is not only susceptible to but in fact fosters its destruction from invasion. Woolf's ambivalence toward her liberalism in the face of invasion, moreover, is inherited by postwar liberal authors.

This essay investigates the fin de siècle writings of Grant Allen, George Gissing, and Mrs. Edward Kennard. It argues that women cyclists, numbering half a million in Britain in the mid-1890s, also participate in this modern culture of speed and lay a claim to a new modern subject energized and enhanced by mechanized speed.

AB  - Images of consumption run throughout Cormac McCarthy's +The Road=, from evocations of a fossil fuel-driven economy to cannibalism. Taken together, grotesque and gothic images of consumption expose the connection between power brokerage and overconsumption or improper consumption of resources. Examining central thematic and aesthetic elements of Anglo-Irish gothic literature in +The Road= reveals the novel's critique of entrenched economic, racial, and gendered power in the US. The man's son, born after the apocalyptic event, represents through his generosity and exilic wandering the novel's antithesis to a geopolitical system characterized by hegemonic power over others and by rampant consumerism.

AB  - This paper addresses the relationship between spiritual communion and technological communications in Thomas Pynchon's +Gravity's Rainbow=. I argue that Pynchon deploys spiritualist imagery as an analogue for the complexities of modern communication, which displaces the human subject from its self-designated role as creator and/or controller of information. While many scholarly ventures into Pynchon's work tend to downplay the importance of his supernatural imagery, I contend that the supernatural plays an important role in his fiction even at the formal level, from which the novel appears to its readers as a kind of spirit board.

Steinbeck's novel and +The Harvest Gypsies=, its nonfiction predecessor, refigure vagrancy into a fantasy involving a mobile class of workers. In doing so, Steinbeck offers an explicit roadmap for a government desperate to move families across the country to where their labor is needed. Ultimately, this reading puts the novel into dialogue with state policies that extend beyond New Deal era.

Reading Joyce's stories in the context of the +Irish Homestead= (1895–1923), the journal of Ireland's agricultural cooperative movement, reveals how his stories borrow the regionalism of the journal's editorials and fiction but are distinguished by the use of modernist narrative techniques. This regional affect defines Joyce's modernism as grounded in the local ecology, history, and culture of his city.

AB  - This essay turns the critical focus on genre in Pauline Hopkins's +Of One Blood= (1902-03) to the spatial and temporal logics of lost-race romance. It argues that pairing Hopkins's assertion of black American identity through ancient Ethiopian civilization with Walter McDougall's founding of white American lineage on disappearing American Indianness in +The Hidden City= (1891) elucidates the neatness and messiness of the genre's ideological functioning. Its imaginary shapes American racial identity by yoking colonial to national space and past to future, reaching across a socially turbulent present within the US that nevertheless emerges significantly in Hopkins's adoption.

AB  - Examining the conflict between personal and collective memory manifested in some of James's autobiographical and fictional writings (+The American Scene, The Bostonians=, 'Pandora,' and 'A Modern Warning'), this paper focuses on the ways in which his female protagonists confront and resist the dominant historical discourse inscribed in monuments and other sites of memory that officially reinforce patriotic national sentiments. Challenging the institutional function of collective memory and the shortcomings of American democracy, James's centers of consciousness rupture the cohesion targeted by national memorializing practices, offering a revisionist account of national identity and belonging.

AB  - This essay reconsiders the racial dynamics of Roald Dahl's +Charlie and the Chocolate Factory= (1964). The Oompa-Loompas, African pygmies in the novel's first drafts, reflect its racism, their cuteness justifying coerced labor and white supremacy. An early manuscript version, 'Charlie's Chocolate Boy,' features a black protagonist trapped in a chocolate mold. Dahl thus connects industrial food production with racialization. In the final version of the novel, the chocolate factory recolors and transforms the bodies of white children, now marked and vulnerable. This ethical lesson complicates the seeming endorsement of white privilege in Charlie's ascent in the Great Glass Elevator.

AB  - In avoiding its war's controversial history and in its allegiance to the present moment, +The Hurt Locker= (2008) actually sharpened its resonance for its contemporary wartime audience. Its reliance on the seemingly discontinuous historicity of moviegoing both obscures and realizes how war films fashion citizenship. The film occupies familiar ground in the American war film genre and its frontier masculinity, with gender dynamics that are markedly traditional for the era that would see the combat exclusion lifted for women and gay soldiers in the US military. Ultimately, the film risks reducing viewers to the function of spectator-citizen-soldiers.

AB  - This essay explores the representation of the Iraq War dead. There is, as yet, no official count of those killed in Iraq. US military policy established a moratorium on representing the American dead, meaning that any images became contested. This essay examines the debates around this fraught question as it emerges in newspaper reportage, photography, confrontational art, and the fiction of the war. It ends with an exploration of fiction by non-American writers Sinan Antoon, Saad Hossain, and Ahmed Saadawi, in whose work there appears an attempt to reinscribe the absent bodies of the Iraq War.

AB  - This essay argues that through the formal strategy of multiple first-person narrators, several novels about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan decenter American experiences, link soldiers' voices to those of 'others,' and open up the question of 'who counts' in war to include civilians, refugees, and other noncombatants. Helen Benedict, Joydeep Roy-Bhattacharya, and Michael Pitre shift the imaginative frame of war to include both the canonical trauma hero and the displaced and disempowered. This formal strategy requires readers to consider the consequences of US military policy and to reassess whose lives matter.

AB  - Recent Iraq War literature has often been appropriated to serve the nationalist purpose of recovering from a conflict that lacks a stable place in history or memory. Focusing on Iraq War narratives that represent the recovery of bodies, living and dead, I explore the military failures, damaged archives, cultural silences, trauma, and human costs they uncover. I suggest here that much recent war writing by Kevin Powers, Brian Turner, Sinan Antoon, and the anonymous Iraqi blogger Riverbend speaks against postwar recovery—whether of bodies, archives, or nationalist and imperialist narratives—in striking ways.

AB  - This paper discusses Nadeem Aslam's Afghanistan-based novels as exemplifying the affordances of what I call the 'geologic turn' in writing traumatic histories in the era of the Anthropocene. Through its attention to the earth as a medium of memory and to war as a multispecies ecology, Aslam's work brings into view geo-mediation—a nonlinguistic, nonhuman witness to human-borne disaster. Aslam's treatment of the military interventions in Afghanistan foregrounds slow and systemic violence, habitat diminishment, and ecosystem degradation, while upholding the resilience of the earth and humanity in deep time.

Set in a post-9/11 barrio, Virginia Grise's +blu= (2011) offers a critique of the militarization of Chicana/o communities. The play challenges the meaning of homeland by juxtaposing Aztlán, the mythic Aztec homeland, with the US homeland. +blu= critiques wartime nationalism and Chicano cultural nationalism by drawing parallels between patriarchal war cultures: the Aztecs, gangs, and the US military. By rewriting myth, it offers more emancipatory notions of homeland belonging.

AB  - Since the War on Terror began, female troops have increasingly participated in combat operations. Even as the wars have created the first known cluster of female combat amputees, their stories are rarely represented or studied. This neglect has resulted in physical and mental health consequences. This article addresses this omission through an analysis of literary representations of injured female troops by Gologorsky, Proulx, and Schultz. I argue that these texts call attention to women as what Mitchell and Snyder call narrative prostheses—artificial supports to male troops—and begin to redress misreadings of their role in contemporary war.

AB  - This essay contends that Don DeLillo’s Cosmopolis (2003) stages its own mastery of what Mark McGurl calls technicity, here figured as “cybercapitalism.” I read the novel’s limousine as the institution through which such mastery is tested. The novel’s close attention to the limousine reveals the ways in which such discourses depend on a network of human and nonhuman actants. This is both a commentary on and a departure from DeLillo’s earlier work, in which such technic ideas largely (though not wholly) floated free of such networks.

In Bell’s All Souls’ Rising, characters and plot blend not just with history and not only through historicity, but balance on acceptance or rejection of the narrators’ distinctly diverse historiographic consciousnesses. Bell establishes the contemporary historical novel by productively querying narrative’s production and embracing its myriad possibilities to create a narrative that rejects unity but aspires to comprehensiveness.

AB  - Kingsolver’s Flight Behavior and Pancake’s Strange as This Weather Has Been revive the commons as place, as concept, and as narrative motivation. The losses that damaging resource extraction produces give rise to new models for sustaining the commons through work. Specifically, the novels’ women protagonists escape restrictive domesticity to become organic intellectuals who shore up the commons through activist and scientific labors that integrate locals’ experiential knowledge into environmentalist and research agendas. The novels veer from traditional commons thinking and historical scholarship on the interplay between labor and environment to propose how knowledge work curbs privatization and resource capture.

AB  - Naomi Klein opens The Shock Doctrine by comparing the psychological hypothesis that an array of shocks “could unmake and erase faulty minds” with Milton Friedman’s economic hypothesis that a course of painful policy shocks could return society to “pure capitalism.” Klein’s book raises the following question: why did shock become the dominant metaphor for economic and psychological modernization? This article suggests that Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged provides one answer, revealing how shock’s emergence as a form of neoliberal subject-making is rooted in the white flight anxieties about racializing and decaying urban cores that emerged in the postwar period.

AB  - One of the defining features of the Celtic Tiger was a massive boom in construction that left a visible mark on the Irish landscape. This essay analyzes the works of Anne Haverty and Donal Ryan to highlight how they use the tropes and lingering traumas of the Famine to criticize contemporary forms of gentrification. In their texts, post-Celtic Tiger communities adopt the signifiers and consequences of a new famine; essentially, they articulate how physical changes to the Irish landscape constitute a “famine of gentrification” that makes land unable to sustain, both materially and culturally, an Irish community.

AB  - This essay seeks to emphasize the interconnections between wandering and dwelling in the context of Sebald’s ambulatory narrative, The Rings of Saturn (1998). By using Heidegger’s notion of “dwelling,” it seeks to highlight the ways in which wandering, with its origin in the ancient human desire for movement and which seems to negate the impulse to dwell or be emplaced in a fixed location, not only transmutes in the contemporary consciousness into an alternative mode of dwelling but also leads to its actualization.

AB  - Though it never names its ecological catastrophe, The Road is increasingly read as a climate-change novel. This essay explores how this narrative of father and son walking a dead landscape speaks to contemporary environmental concerns. Adapting apocalyptic techniques, it contrasts a lost humanity (that is, being both human and humane) against present inhumanity, locating the measure of humanity in the father’s care for his son. Thus, the novel resonates with contemporary anxieties about caring for the future, anxieties often expressed in the figure of the child. The novel’s conclusion, however, affords the opportunity of rising above such anxieties.

Even as Coetzee’s work models an ideal of hospice that resonates with Derrida’s conception of unconditional hospitality, it also attends to how this ideal is constrained by a global neoliberal regime that conceives of dying as a crisis to be managed. Coetzee’s fiction envisions both care for the dying and dying itself not only as managed, routinized labor but also as potentially unmanageable acts of creation.

AB  - It is no mere coincidence that the fictional character Leonard Bankhead in Jeffrey Eugenides’s The Marriage Plot resembles the author David Foster Wallace. By directly invoking Wallace, Eugenides engages in an artistic battle with Wallace that both parodies Wallace’s public battles with his postmodern forebears and transforms Harold Bloom’s Oedipal model of artistic influence into a love triangle. The Marriage Plot not only revives the traditional love story through metafictional parody but also playfully pits Eugenides against Wallace as rivals for the reader’s affection.

AB  - The romance novel is often described as a conservative genre, inflexible in its narrative forms and committed to reproducing traditional social structures. Yet historically the genre has had a disruptive rather than stabilizing effect on British cultural identity. This article reads Mary Renault’s first romance novel, Purposes of Love, against the backdrop of interwar attacks on popular fiction. Renault’s startlingly dark novels reveal a common thread between the conservative commitments of the romance and the eugenics-inflected rhetoric of highbrow literary criticism. The bleakness of their purportedly happy endings also raises questions about the political investments of contemporary recovery projects.

Rather than reading the narrative’s resistance as a necessary outcome of Hemingway’s minimalist style, this essay argues that the novel flattens the lived world inhabited by reader and character in order to enact at the level of representation a dynamic of absent presence that registers Frederic’s traumatic loss of Catherine.

This article argues that such distinctions respond to the alternative discourses of beauty, internationalism, empire, and Afro-Orientalism that emerge in the advertisements, salons, and lifestyles of black beauty culturalists Madam C.J. and A’Lelia Walker. Du Bois and the Walkers offer competing accounts of what spaces, practices, and images of beauty support desired forms of community, intimacy, and agency on a global scale.

The articlebegins with Fitzgerald’s youthful infatuation with decadence at Princeton, explores his critique of decadence in The Great Gatsby, and concludes with his ambivalent revisiting of the literatures of decaying Europe in Tender Is the Night. The essay uses the symbol of the Dance of Death and the motif of the dying fall as indexes for Fitzgerald’s shifting relationship to this European model of decline.

Specifically, reading Hagedorn alongside the late nineteenth-century Filipino patriot and national hero José Rizal reveals a previously unidentified genre, the guerrilla conversion narrative.

AB  - This essay argues that Louise Erdrich’s Love Medicine makes visible the subject of collective rights of recent indigenous political activism by reshaping the usual conflict between individual protagonists and the societies they inhabit, the conflict between what Georg Lukács calls “the soul and the world.” Moreover, I contend that, while tribalist, the novel’s politics of representation differ from those of Native American nationalism, which tasks literature and criticism with establishing a tribal nation’s cultural distinctiveness.

AB  - In this essay I argue that Baldwin’s depiction of queer possibility depends on the spectacular failure of heterosexuality to ensure the future, a failure that ultimately severs heterosexuality from its procreative logics and justifications. Gabriel is torn between competing drives: his desire to ensure the Grimes line and desire itself. Ironically, the latter troubles the former, as the excess of sexual desire threatens to overrun the marital and procreative logics that make the heterosexual normative. Gabriel models heterosexuality as both desire and procreative engine, highlighting the ways in which heterosexuality contains within itself the seeds of its own undoing.

AB  - Since their deaths, Homer and Langley Collyer have become mainstays in conversations about hoarding, as well as characters in numerous pieces of modern fiction. This essay examines the literary tropes that shaped the mid-twentieth-century fascination with the brothers. It traces this genealogy through four successive fictionalizations of the Collyers’ lives by Marcia Davenport, Stephen King, Charles Johnson, and E. L. Doctorow. Ultimately, the Collyers occasion a unique opportunity to think about modern fiction’s role in the contemporary invention of the hoarder.

AB  - From Willa Cather’s first novel to her last, the railroad served as a powerful figure for modernity, westward expansion, and class ascent. Advantaged by her family’s arrival in Nebraska during boom times and expanded access to job markets and inspirational vacations via the railroads, Cather provides many friendly briefs on their behalf. Yet in confronting women’s uncertain status in the bourgeois narrative of ascent and displaying a complex mixture of attitudes toward Native Americans and the working classes, Cather’s railroad-age fiction came ultimately to stage a multifaceted, if ambivalent, critique of class inequality in US culture.

AB  - This essay asks that we read E. M.

It argues that the novel, an example of modernist Orientalism, draws its archive from works of enlightenment Orientalism, including Fay’s Original Letters from India and Gibbes’s Hartly House, Calcutta. Far from trying to resolve questions of empire or offering a universal feminism, the novel negotiates and rewrites the place of the bourgeois woman to the metropolis by way of the colony.

AB  - Tropic of Orange rethinks postmodernism, its relationship to neoliberalism, and the political implications of a form of collectivity modeled on the World Wide Web. In Yamashita’s novel, the network is the privileged figure for the ontological condition of the neoliberal world order and for a mode of postnational belonging endowed with the potential to instigate radical change. As the novel struggles with this potential, it prefigures and significantly complicates the controversial vision of postmodern politics that Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri began elaborating three years after the novel came to press.

It draws on sound studies, postcolonial ecocriticism, and new materialist perspectives to reveal an aesthetic that combines the act of listening with an environmental awareness in ways that transform matter into both the receptacle and the bearer of silenced indigenous voices. Countering ocularcentric paradigms, it shows that modernity is characterized as much by particular ideas about sound as it is by regimes of visuality and induces a more viscerally engaged, ecologically sensitive humanism.

In particular, it argues that the novel takes up the narrative conventions of the classic bildungsroman in order to unthink the liberal constraints of freedom and belonging established by possessive individualism. By troubling the aesthetic ideas of self-ownership within the classic bildungsroman, the novel not only 'turns out' possessive individualism but generates an alternative account of freedom and belonging that reckons with the racialized and gendered history of self-ownership and property.

AB  - Fiction in the history of modern Chinese literature has been increasingly dominating literary production, ranking the top among all the genres. Contemporary Chinese fiction is thus a universally recognized major literary genre that has long been practiced in a glocalized Chinese context although it has been largely influenced by its Western counterpart. Thus it has been qualified enough to dialogue with both classical Chinese fiction as well as Western texts. In this introductory article eminent contemporary Chinese novelists are also discussed in a historical and critical way with regard to their relations with world literature.

AB  - The English translation of Yan Geling’s Jinling Shisan Chai includes several new additions that are suggestive of key differences between Chinese and Western conceptions of narrative and history. Whereas the Chinese original challenges monolithic interpretations of history with a self-consciously mythologized reading of the past, the international version seeks to counter revisionist histories and the cynicism of the assumed Western reader with additions that emphasize the materiality of the historical event. I argue that the additions highlight the impossibility of reconstituting material history through narrative and calls for a reassessment of the ethics of historical fiction.

In what ways does his fiction become a testimony to the Cultural Revolution? How is Gao’s exilic narrative of China’s past different from that of other Chinese writers? How is Gao able to both deconstruct and reconstruct Chineseness in his novels?

AB  - This essay explores work by Chinese writers of the 1980s and 1990s, arguing that the period between the Cultural Revolution and the late twentieth century economic transformations produced a literary surge not known in mainland China since the May Fourth writers. Drawing on work by Ge Fei, Can Xue, Yu Hua, Mo Yan, Su Tong, and Yu Hua, this essay examines how Chinese writers produced strategies to convey a profound sense of psychic and temporal disorientation and historical suspension. Doggedly avoiding doctrines of historical progressiveness, these writers uproot and contort reality and collapse boundaries between the past and present.

AB  - Compared with its Western counterpart, Chinese metafiction is a complicated case that flourished in the mixture of modernism and postmodernism and of local sentiments and the globalized context. While Chinese postmodernism has been adequately examined, Chinese metafiction has seldom been explored. To approach the core of Chinese modern/postmodern metafiction, a holistic view is required and a typology is to be established. I identify a typology of Chinese metafiction in terms of four innovative modes, and Chinese metafiction from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s presents different densities along the range of these four modes.

AB  - This essay argues that changes in American energy infrastructure from carbon-based power plants to distributed, renewable energy networks precipitate changes in American literary regionalism. Examining recent regional fiction including Jay Tyrell’s Wind Army, Paolo Bacigalupi’s “The Tamarisk Hunter,” and Richard Powers’s The Echo Maker, I argue that stories of climate-change infrastructure replace models of geographical difference based in enduring biomarkers with a more volatile regionalism that foregrounds the relationships among local, national, and global networks and that is distinguishable from the country’s cultural centers by its even more rapid pace of change.

AB  - This essay examines the impact that scenario planning has had on recent South African fiction. It first investigates how the popular use of scenario planning disseminated certain ideas about the timescale of infrastructural growth. These ideas, I argue, were vital tools in eliciting a consensus for structural adjustment policies among South Africa’s ruling elite. The essay’s second half then turns to Lauren Beukes’s science-fiction novel Zoo City. Beukes’s novel, I show, mimics scenario planning’s approach to capitalist time, but it does so in order to suggest that scenario planning misses the deeper, contradictory modes of temporality that inhere in infrastructure.

AB  - This essay analyzes automobility in three postcolonial urban Nigerian novels: the fantasy of self-propulsion that subtends a colonial modernity materialized through the erection of urban infrastructure. Tracing the disjuncture between automobility and infrastructure—the “problem of locomotion” (Achebe)—reveals the inextricability of mobility, modernity, urbanism, and colonial violence even into Nigeria’s formally postcolonial period. By exploring how characters both invest in and move beyond inherited colonial narratives, these novels challenge top-down images of Lagos, instead depicting it as a city “otherwise fashioned” (Abani) from their characters’ perspectives on what it feels like to dwell and sell on the streets.

Augusto’s peripatetic literary project gives him a kind of imaginative power with which he hopes to achieve 'a greater communion' with the city. This essay explores the possibility that, rather than literary production, public works—specifically, the management of water and sewage—might allow for the greater communion that Augusto claims to desire.

AB  - This article reads Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go as an experiment in sentient infrastructure. Narrated by Kathy H., the subject of a government cloning program, her infrastructural interiority is characterized not only by its limited style but also by its attention to the immediate material environment. While the main problem of the novel is how to understand the clone’s personhood, Ishiguro dramatizes this through a spatial vocabulary, especially the difference between Hailsham, the privileged estate where Kathy grew up, and the rest of the program’s facilities. The novel can thus be read as deliberating over infrastructure’s signifying ability, both its potential and desirability.

AB  - This essay examines the relationship between uneven economic development and the differential distribution of trash. Drawing from fictional genres of urban discontent and photography of metropolitan peripheries, this article considers how aesthetic engagement with garbage has been integral for imagining the ends of infrastructure. The cultural transformation in the treatment of waste crystallizes around two moments. The first, roughly coterminous with literary modernism, marks the formalization of waste infrastructures in Western cities. Secondly, during the second wave of urbanization, the traffic of waste became a transnational and increasingly privatized affair; the garbage dump, as in Tekin’s Tales from Garbage Hills, became newly available as the ground of contemporary artworks.

And it argues that the defamiliarizing strategies of realist fiction also work well to unsettle the privileged obliviousness that prevents us from noticing structures and infrastructures in everyday life. The article’s central example is Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s novel, Americanah, which draws on realist traditions to defamiliarize both race and electricity.

AB  - In demonstrating how scholarship has neglected African and Caribbean influences in Morrison’s work, this essay argues that there is a conspicuous gap in classifications of the character of Beloved. There is compelling evidence that African religious concepts of the living-dead, the Caribbean concept of the zombi, and the American adaptation of the zombi as zombie all bear profound influence on the composite identity of the character of Beloved. The hybrid assembly of the mythical and monstrous creature of Beloved thus establishes a new creation in an evolving transnational cultural tradition.

AB  - In Ian McEwan’s novel Sweet Tooth, a wariness of an extreme form of (human) control characteristic of Cold War politics indirectly reflects an anxiety about authorial manipulation. Rather than asserting his own direct authority over the text, McEwan uses tropes of romance and espionage to interrogate the conjunction of power and masculinity on which his authorship—and the cultural-political divide, largely speaking—is predicated. By foregrounding the perspective of a female spy, doubly positioned as the lover and reader of the writer within the novel, Sweet Tooth complicates what it means to construct narrative authority, while also challenging the binary thinking that dominated the Cold War years.

AB  - In Cormac McCarthy’s All the Pretty Horses, John Grady Cole was born in Texas and raised for perhaps 15 of his 16 years by a family of Mexican origin. A close inspection of his Latin American cultural attachments belies the critical readings of the character, which generally describe him as Anglo-American (in a cultural sense) who is a native speaker of English. McCarthy destabilizes the mythic cowboy through Cole, who performs a Mexican-American identity in Texas and Mexico. This article reexamines the cultural geography of the Grady-Cole homestead, the town of San Angelo, and the South and West Texas border area to offer new perspectives on John Grady’s cultural identity.

AB  - British novelist John Fowles’s The Magus (1965) is typically interpreted by critics as an early postmodern narrative about freedom and authenticity; however, this novel also engages directly with imperial contraction and changing notions of Englishness during the postwar decades. Fowles attempts through the novel’s complex plot, centered on the travel of its young male protagonist from London to Greece and back again, to revivify a pre-imperial English identity and counter the prevailing imperial nostalgia of the 1960s. In the process, Fowles demonstrates the insufficiency of British Mediterranean travel narratives to define Englishness in an emerging postimperial context.

AB  - This essay contextualizes several of Langston Hughes’s mid-1930s short fiction works, exploring ways in which these Black Marxist writings expose racism as a function of an absolutist US nationalist discourse. The essay argues that the short story “Cora Unashamed” is a crucial document of interwar period African American internationalist literature, as it imparts a black modernist fable that rearticulates the realist folklore of the 1930s Left. The article then considers several stories that carry on the radical socialist theme, including “The Blues I’m Playing,” “Little Old Spy,” “Why, You Reckon?”, “On the Road,” “Professor,” “Gumption,” and “The Trouble with Angels.”

AB  - This essay analyzes the meanings surrounding E. M. Forster’s treatment of the dying and death, early in Howards End, of one of the major characters, Mrs. Wilcox. It builds on Victorian and Edwardian social and cultural expectations of dying at home, Forster’s preoccupation with dying in the home in which one is born, and the difficult dying that Ruth Wilcox undergoes in a nursing home, to analyze Forster’s subtle delineation of the depths of treachery within the Wilcox household. This rereading of Forster’s novel underlines the importance of critically appraising Forster’s silences and looking for his misdirections and indirections.

AB  - In this article, I argue that James’s What Maisie Knew investigates the consequences of a distinctly modern mode of observation that both depends on and subverts literary naturalism’s trope of the sensually vulnerable but inarticulate brute—a mode of observation much like the kind of snapshot photography that was widely practiced at the turn of the century. With her innate and curiously modern perceptual sensibilities, James’s Maisie gestures toward an anxiety about the potential of naturalism’s brutes to tell their own stories—an anxiety that I argue was also evinced by the rise of snapshot photography as a popular and affordable hobby.

AB  - Don DeLillo has been repeatedly drawn to a frightening scenario in which a man meets a woman at an art venue and proceeds to stalk her. Adopting the structure of repetition-compulsion displayed in these narratives, the present study moves back and forth between 'Baader-Meinhof' and subsequent iterations of the art stalker theme in +Falling Man=, +Point Omega=, and 'The Starveling.' What makes this scenario particularly disturbing are the links DeLillo draws between the subjective virtual effects art has on a spectator and the pathological extensions of those effects into real-world crimes.

AB  - In what many consider to be a postrealist age, what are the new modes emerging that reflect a continued investment in representing contemporary life? This essay outlines the contours of a new social realism through the works of contemporary novelist Aravind Adiga. Against the grain of recent Indian writing, Adiga constructs a virulent critique of contemporary social issues. Adiga's realism is not transparent, but instead raises a set of open-ended questions about the nature of interpretation, elaborating a 'realist hieroglyphics'—the presentation of realism as a mode founded on indecipherability—as an aesthetics central to the political novel.

AB  - Incompatible generic and political judgments have divided critical discussion of Richard Wright's +Native Son= for 70 years. Far from indicating the novel's failure to cohere, this essay shows how the contest between naturalist and existential readings of +Native Son= emerged from the novel allegorizing midcentury liberalism's equivocal concept of judgment. In its rhetoric of blindness, +Native Son= anticipates and thematizes antithetical 'blind' judgments of Bigger. By treating this structuring rhetorical pattern as evidence of Wright's critique of liberalism, we might move beyond the novel's dichotomous reception and consider how +Native Son= performs the critical function associated with literary modernism.

AB  - This article studies Paul's queer adolescence at the intersection of narrative, time, and sexuality. Although Paul's effeminacy evokes homosexuality, he is not a gay-identified subject who looks back on his boyhood and defines it as protogay. To convert his boyhood effeminacy into protogay boyhood is problematic. Paul also renounces the arc of normative, capitalist adulthood by desiring to be rich without climbing the social ladder rung by rung and by killing himself. His suicide undoes transitional views of adolescence.

AB  - Sui Sin Far's fiction investigates the anxieties of white masculinity and the reification of racial identity, which is embodied in a statue of Robert Louis Stevenson in her short story 'Its Wavering Image.' Reading the statue as a 'dialectical image' illuminates the doubling and splitting that haunts early twentieth-century white American masculinity and is displaced onto Chinese-American and Eurasian subjects. This essay demonstrates Sui Sin Far's nuanced participation in American literary and social movements of her time, most significantly her utopianized imaginings of mixed and ambiguously raced children in America.

AB  - While Kipling's 1902 story 'Wireless' has often been thought to exemplify an already outmoded realist narration, this essay argues that the story is an early experiment with impressionism. Midway through, the narrator's point of view suddenly becomes distorted and private. The story makes sense of this change through the figure of the wireless telegraph, which Kipling uses to imagine a dizzying excess of technological chatter—a serious concern in contemporary discourse about the wireless—that makes communication impossible and isolates the individual despite his permeability to the world. 'Wireless' reveals impressionism to be a specifically post-telegraphic telecommunication discourse.

The narrators' obsession with the Lisbon family and home evolves into a meditation on isolation, containment, and the ideological privileging of suburban domesticity. Reading against the grain of the narrators' voyeuristic project, we see how this narrative about a local tragedy extends to questions of the domestic, the foreign, nation, and empire across the long Cold War era.

I then move to an overview of cross-disciplinary conversations about animals and human-animal relationships being conducted under rubrics such as critical animal studies, posthumanism, cognitive ethology, and zoosemiotics, and suggest how the essays included in the present issue intervene in the larger context for research afforded by these conversations.

Instead of telling stories about animals, a metanarrative such as +Bird Lovers, Backyard= is a montage and reworking of a wide range of existing forms of narrative as well as a critical engagement with the works and authors that exemplify them.

AB  - Aravind Adiga's 2008 novel +The White Tiger= appropriates an animal perspective in order to represent an animalization of the poor that runs counter to popular narratives of India's economic growth; the novel uncritically deploys an anthropocentric perspective that is premised on the abjection of the animal and the sanctity of the human. At the same time, the narrative's pivotal moment turns on the Deleuzo-Guattarian becoming-animal of the protagonist. This instance of mutual exposure transgresses humanist boundaries and infects the spaces of the text with a counter-narrative of contagion that suggests a different ethical potential for postcolonial, and posthumanist, representation.

AB  - This essay theorizes the aesthetic in J. M. Coetzee's +Disgrace= as a tendency of the living-in-general through an emphasis on the protagonist's devolving chamber opera. The bio-aesthetic in this articulation profoundly exceeds the domain of the human and should be viewed as a creaturely orientation of life to other life. The species barrier is therefore rendered porous through a becominganimal of art in the novel. This becoming leads the protagonist toward an eroticoartistic posture that is on the margins of a properly 'human' world.

Examining the representation of a gray wolf in Cormac McCarthy's novel +The Crossing=, it concludes that the animal's agency (and, by extension, the agency of all literary animals) emerges when its behavior temporarily exhausts, confuses, or transforms the human use to which it has been put.

AB  - Even when they appear to signify a symbolic function, animals in James Joyce's +Finnegans Wake= generally remain grounded in the ecology of the natural world. We see a hen scavenging a ravaged landscape after battle, two cavemen struggling to acquire the means to speak and communicate, and hear the conflicting insects in a version of Aesop's fable of the ant and the grasshopper argue. Yet all of these +Wake= an creatures remind us that the cultural contexts of their narratives reflect the need for food, habitat, and other resources necessary for the survival of living beings.

AB  - This essay reads Virginia Woolf's +Flush= as a canine +Bildungsroman= that challenges this genre's humanist and phallocentric underpinnings. Woolf signals the phallocentrism of traditional +Bildung= by contextualizing Flush's development within circumstances that parallel those of the woman writer. Rather than simply serving as a proxy for the woman writer, the figure of the dog exposes the anthropocentrism that underwrites the privileging of male experience throughout the literary canon. Ultimately, I show how Woolf intertwines the +Bildung= processes of Flush and Elizabeth to develop a model of literary character that extends beyond the gendered category of the human and reflects the companion-species entanglements that give shape to human and nonhuman experience.

AB  - By way of imaginative engagements with animal life, literature seems ideally positioned to address the gap between scientific knowledge and 'what it is like' (in Thomas Nagel's phrase) to be an animal. Yet my article argues that the differences between literary representations of animal experience and scientific methods for studying nonhuman consciousness should not be overlooked. No matter how plausible they are, literature's animal phenomenologies play by hermeneutic - not scientific - rules. A 1927 short story by Italo Svevo, 'Argo and His Master,' helps me interrogate the power as well as the limitations of literary figurations of nonhuman experience.

AB  - This essay examines Henry James's 'The Beast in the Jungle' through the dual lenses of feminist theory and animality studies. It argues that May Bartram slowly erodes John Marcher's related senses of patriarchal pride and species exceptionalism, exposing him absolutely to an environment over which he no longer exercises dominion. Conceptualizing gender and species performativity as related enterprises rooted in particular ways of seeing, the story comes to envision configurations of animality and sexuality more fluid and less violent than those espoused by the ideological distortions of Darwin that gained momentum in the early twentieth century.

AB  - As zoo design shifted late in the nineteenth century from a taxonomic model to more ambitious 'natural' and 'authentic' exhibits, the zoo began to draw more heavily on literary strategies of display and audience interaction. The introduction of 'narrativized display,' in which the zoo visitor is guided through an ideologically aware and carefully controlled experience featuring devices such as backstories and dramatic climaxes, allowed for the fostering of an emotional, not just logical, connection to the animal. Ultimately, the 'authentic' zoo emerges as a new and influential form of fiction-derived spatial communication.

AB  - New Zealand Māori writer Witi Ihimaera has long used his fiction as commentary on postcolonial politics. In The Uncle's Story (2000), Ihimaera portrays a protagonist who combines an assertion of gay rights with a denunciation of white oppression. As the protagonist engages in a liberatory struggle on behalf of the Māori people and in advocacy of a gay tribe; however, he displays a patriarchal conceptualization of subjective agency that denies the mutuality of respectful intersubjective recognition. This not only causes severe contradictions in himself, but also gives rise to potential difficulties in the organization and practice of community life.

AB  - This essay argues that Vikram Chandra's spy thriller Sacred Games (2007) rewrites Rudyard Kipling's Kim (1901). Kipling's Kim, as has been widely argued and acknowledged, encompasses the colonial state's demarcation between the passive, spiritual Orient and the rational, secular Occident through the trope of the Great Game. Chandra's text deconstructs this dichotomy by rewriting the sacred into the political through the trope of the 'sacred game,' which replaces the Great Game of Kim. Sacred Games' rewriting of a canonical colonial text makes it a novel of both postmodernism and postmodernization.

The approach to nonsense developed in the 1930s and 1940s by ordinary language philosophers like Ludwig Wittgenstein and J. L. Austin is pertinent to our understanding of O'Brien's literary nonsense, not only for what it reveals about his literary technique, but also for the light it sheds on his cultural historical positioning as a novelist writing in the immediate aftermath of high modernism.

AB  - From Native Son forward, the desire to escape the No-Man's Land of blackness and achieve an apparently unraced manhood is characteristic of Richard Wright's black male protagonists. In his efforts to claim manhood, Bigger Thomas violently rejects black domesticity and the various modes of black identity presented in the novel. Thus, despite his similarities to the colonized subject as described by Frantz Fanon, we should not read Bigger as a model of revolutionary black manhood. And in rejecting blackness, no other identity is available to Bigger besides 'nigger,' for manhood in the United States has never been unraced.

In 'Writing Politically,' Janis Stout argues that a number of Canfield's novels, including The Bent Twig (1915), The Brimming Cup (1921), The Home-Maker (1924), Her Son's Wife (1926), The Deepening Stream (1930), Bonfire (1933), and Seasoned Timber (1939), can rightly be labeled political fiction

This essay furthers a mimetic line of inquiry in modernist studies and argues that Conrad's images of darkness cast shadows that are neither realistic nor impressionistic, but surrealistic instead.

Pham's narrative reveals the blind spots demanded by a nation that celebrates immigration as evidence of the highest American values while avoiding full knowledge of immigrant lives.

AB  - My essay analyzes both +High Fidelity= and selected Britpop songs and videos, and reads these texts within the highly contested field of realism's larger relationship to 'what's out there.' The essay examines the ways in which Hornby's novel articulates a male domestic sphere and explores values typically associated with the British working class - ones regularly reinforced in 1990s (or 'Cool Britannia'-era) texts such as +Loaded= magazine. Ultimately, I analyze how +High Fidelity=, like many canonical realist novels, imagines a form of social unity that supersedes the divergent social class 'realities' depicted.

AB  - Traditional atheists believe that the loss of faith leads to melancholic mourning. New atheists, by contrast, consider the God-concept to be a hideous human invention, so they rejoice rather than mourn on the occasion of God's death. Sophie is a traditional atheist early in the novel +Sophie's Choice=, but she is a new atheist by the end. What leads to her transformation is her realization that Christianity made the Nazis believe that exterminating the Jews was a political necessity. She makes this discovery in a conversation with the eleven-year-old Emmi, the daughter of the Commandant of Auschwitz.

AB  - Legal scholar Robert Cover's concept of +jurisgenesis=, the creation of legal meaning by polities, offers a revealing window into the historical prologues and dramatic action of William Faulkner's +Requiem for a Nun=. Cover's work clarifies how Faulkner's character Nancy Mannigoe, an African American domestic convicted of infanticide, exhibits a +nomos=, or normative vision, to rival that of Yoknapatawpha County's official legal system. The text, however, remains evasive about the imaginative sources of Nancy's +nomos= in the antinomian power of contemporaneous civil rights activity, whose spectacles of collective black political agency triggered a troubling form of censorship in Faulkner's artistic vision.

AB  - This article argues that both decadent writers and Mary Butts utilized sickness and the occult to alter perception and evade the strictures of bourgeois religiosity and experience. It looks at Butts's brief and troubled alliance with Aleister Crowley to demonstrate how she developed an ethics of occultism that sought to heal those sickened by modernity and then examines her literary experiments with magic through readings of her short stories 'Mappa Mundi' and 'Brightness Falls.' Butts sought to create literature that revealed magic's latent presence in a disenchanted world and demonstrate its rejuvenating potential.

The name 'India' functions there as a double catachresis that ultimately brings together the 'problem' of India with the ethical and political issues at the heart of the novel. Woolf's invocation of Indian women, in particular, ultimately points toward the importance of the absent encounter with the other woman as ethical remainder, suggesting that any question of feminist ethics is, necessarily, a question of transnational feminist ethics.

AB  - James Joyce's 'Eveline' poses the question of Ireland's identity within the British Empire in indirect but powerful terms. In its depiction of Eveline's paralyzing suspension between home and world, Joyce's story echoes the contemporary cultural nationalist diagnosis of modern Ireland as an 'unworkable compound' of imperial and national affinities. Joyce, however, presents this unworkable compound as a constitutive condition of modern Irish life, not an inauthentic imposition. 'Eveline' thus highlights what is distinctive about Joyce's representation of Ireland and empire, as Joyce dramatizes how ordinary Irish people experienced that relationship in all its varied aspects of participation and subordination.

AB  - This essay argues that Kazuo Ishiguro's +Never Let Me Go= draws an analogy between the lives of the clones and the experience of the racially marginalized, exposing the contradictions of contemporary genomic science in which race is being both effaced and revived as biological concept. As Ishiguro critiques the current postracial era, he presents an alternative postracial vision, which evokes Darwin's theory of the universality of expression and thus the common descent of different races. Through Kathy's privileging of facial expressions in her narrative, the novel offers a view of kinship that moves beyond the genetic assumptions that underpin (racial) identity politics, toward a model of reciprocity based on a nonbiological, nonracial affinity.

I focus on the line of inquiry in this emergent critical interest that sees multilingualism as a corrective to the shortcomings of multiculturalism based on the idea that language is a matter of voluntary affiliation. By employing Pierre Bourdieu's notion of linguistic capital to trace a racialized subject's desire for linguistic capital and the intersections of language and race in the novel, I argue that +Japanese By Spring= attends to a substantial oversight in this approach to linguistic pluralism.

I argue that Cliff's and Phillips's invocations of Frank's +Diary= participate in a larger Caribbean intellectual tradition of crosscultural engagement with the Holocaust. I further suggest that their articulations of Holocaust memory need to be read against an additional frame of reference: the deep historical presence of Sephardic Jews in the Caribbean. This historical consciousness at once supports and complicates the identification with Frank in Cliff's +Abeng= and Phillips's +The Nature of Blood=.

The publications, arguments, and key points of intersubjective ethics in Levinas's work that Schwarz-Bart encountered are carefully examined. The argument confronts the critical reception of Levinas's concepts of the feminine and dwelling to demonstrate how, when seen through a Judaic lens, these notions form a new gendered reading of Schwarz-Bart's +The Last of the Just=.

This effectively transformed the internment into a strategic game that Japanese Americans, as my readings of three internment-era novels suggest, also understood themselves as playing.

Characters as diverse as Undine Spragg and Pauline Manford make fundamental choices about their bodies based on mass media's prescriptions. Wharton anticipated these concerns in the early novel +The House of Mirth=, wherein she comments on a relatively new social reality: thinness bestows cultural capital.

AB  - Henry James is not usually read as having much to do with China or transpacific commerce. However, his writing reflects a sustained awareness of the early nineteenth-century China trade's effect on the visual and cultural landscape of New England where the first American millionaires deposited fortunes amassed in a world system of commerce. References to the China Trade resonate in James's intensely visual literary style through which he verbally sketches social landscapes that convey an aura of national culture. These social landscapes eventually register his deep alienation in regard to the moral implication of American fortunes.

AB  - This article argues that Dashiell Hammett's least-known novel, +The Dain Curse=, which is often read as a metacritique of the detective form, actually operates as a hard-boiled critique of the competing pulp weird tale, most associated with H. P. Lovecraft. Hammett's novel exposes the weird tale's inherent nativism and its implicit reliance on notions of the criminally degenerate body popularized by Cesare Lombroso. +The Dain Curse= dismantles the positivism of Lombrosian criminology, weird fiction, and - by extension - the classical ratiocinative detective tradition, and their attendant eugenic epistemology.

AB  - In Tim O'Brien's Going after Cacciato, the main character Paul Berlin fantasizes a young Vietnamese refugee named Sarkin Aung Wan. Berlin conjures Wan from generic conventions from the western, the romance, the war story, and most originally in O'Brien scholarship, contemporary depictions of the National Liberation Front's female peace negotiator Nguyen Thi Binh. This essay suggests that by drawing attention to Wan as a product of Berlin's imagination, the novel produces a metafictional construction of authorship and an imaginative construction of cross-gender identification that distance the novel from gender ideologies traditionally associated with war fiction.

AB  - Philip Roth's The Plot Against America recapitulates the history of mid-twentieth-century American race relations, and the novel's repudiation of these assimilationist events makes it the most multicultural of his novels. But in raising the specter of one model of Jewish difference (racial) only to replace it with another (cultural), Roth is blind to the animating model (religious) of the contemporary period's conservative Christian resurgence. Widely read as being a critical response to that resurgence, the novel's evacuation of religious meaning suggests how poorly prepared Roth was to tackle the religious energy that overtook the nation during his long career.

AB  - This article develops the concept of 'misfit minorities,' drawing on the Christopher Isherwood archive, and focusing on Isherwood's seminal novel, A Single Man, and his autobiographical revision of the Berlin years, Christopher and His Kind. The essay argues that Isherwood's Single Man and his American, post-1960s literary persona as a staunch advocate for gay liberation needs to be revisited, given the novel's ambivalence toward the politics of identity, and given Isherwood's aesthetic distrust of the instrumentalization of literature as propaganda. Rather, we ought to reconsider Isherwood and his legacy as consistently suspicious of identity. Rather than deprecating his earlier works (such as the Berlin Stories) as closeted gay fictions, we should read them as queer literary texts, rendering Isherwood not only a standard-bearer for gay liberation, but a complex queer thinker, who develops a 'misfit' literary aesthetic of ascetic impersonality and queer relationality, before the ascendance of gay publics and politics in our own era, after Stonewall.

AB  - The language of disease suffuses Richard Wright's A Father's Law, functioning as a metaphor for systemic corruption. However, for Marie Wiggins, the novel's Virgin Mary figure, Wright's metaphoric disease becomes literal. Marie suffers from congenital syphilis, which she inherited from her father. In rendering disease as patrilineal, Wright seems to criticize corrupt municipal and spiritual fathers. However, finally Wright puts the onus on the Marian figure to maintain familial and social bonds. Thus, what looks like female veneration actually serves as scapegoating: in taking on the role of the sacred, Marie also takes on the role of ultimate sin.

AB  - This essay traces how discourses of Jewishness circulating in the imperial metropole during the early twentieth century are translated into colonial settings in Leonard Woolf's Village in the Jungle, a translation visible in Woolf's representations of colonial sexual alterity and in his critique of colonial power. The intersections of semitic and colonial discourses in Woolf's novel bring together structures of domestic discrimination and foreign domination; the text thus offers us a transnational framework of interpretation that highlights the necessity of reading histories of oppression in tandem rather than in isolation.

AB  - This article explores Ian McEwan's negotiation of the 'two-culture' debate between literature and science in The Child in Time (1987) and Enduring Love (1997). My claim is that these novels update this debate by introducing ideas put forward in the field of contemporary popular science, while also placing popular science in conversation with literary postmodernism. In particular, I consider the degree of cultural authority his novels grant to science within the contemporary, recognizing both the priority given to scientific values as a basis for social knowledge and also their constructedness and therefore susceptibility to political appropriation.

It explores with reference to the essays and to several works not treated in them various features modernist life narratives share, including failure (especially of social integration) as success, development as deformation, nonlinear temporality, and identity as fluid (rather than singular) and as opaque, or masked. Modernist life narrative's persistence after World War II is addressed with regard to film, American fiction, and postcolonial writing.

In postcolonial fiction, the fissure, or contradiction, in classical +Bildung= and modernity itself becomes the source of new forms of identity and community. Assia Djebar's Algerian Quartet explores alternative means of achieving cultural and aesthetic wholeness through new modes of auto/biographical writing. In her nonlinear, polyvocal, and syncopated narratives, we find instead alternatives to conventional +Bildung= that are more adaptable to non-Western modes of social belonging.

In earlier work Naipaul used realist techniques to depict the periphery as the product of a historical derangement. In +Enigma=, Naipaul focuses on himself as a narrating subject who is the product of a disturbance that he cannot overthrow, only channel. The originality of +The Enigma of Arrival= lies in its attempt to engage, at the level of form, the disorienting effects of the periphery's induction into modernity.

AB  - Gertrude Stein's +The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas= (1933) amalgamates narrative and market-making aims. Adapting important formal features of the novel, the text depicts the story of the cubist movement to reveal how financial and creative speculation motivates modern art movements. Ventriloquizing Toklas enables Stein to distinguish the social world's version of speculation (embodied by Toklas) from Stein's aesthetic version. Simultaneously, the women's committed partnership renders monetary and aesthetic speculation indivisible and interdependent. Stein's feminine 'wife' represents the degraded public sphere, while the text allegorizes different forms of speculation, knowledge, and value, binding them together.

AB  - This article explores the Modernist life narrative in the context of interwar citizenship policies that exposed women to an increased risk of statelessness on both sides of the Atlantic. Read together, Agnes Smedley's +Daughter of Earth= (1929) and Virginia Woolf's +Three Guineas= (1938) bring this transnational context into view. While access to rights may indicate the ideal endpoint of subject-formation in the traditional +Bildungsroman=, Woolf and Smedley demonstrate how women's access to rights comes at the cost of nonnormative desire. Their works use a rhetoric of incivility to mark emergent agencies within and alongside formal structures of citizenship.

AB  - Virginia Woolf's +Flush: A Biography= (1933) takes its place alongside +Orlando= as a key modernist experiment with the norms and conventions of life writing. +Flush= is what might be described as a metabiographical text, probing the consequences for life writing, revealing it to be an inextricable entanglement not just of male, female, upper-, and lower-class life histories, but also of human and nonhuman ways of encountering the world. Furthermore, in modeling nonhuman phenomenology, +Flush= suggests how coming to terms with stories about nonhuman lives calls for a new, 'transdisciplinary' paradigm for narrative inquiry.

AB  - For many late Victorians, the death of Oscar Wilde in 1900 marked a victory for the normalizing narratives that constituted the Victorian eminent life. In retaliation, a small coterie of writers sought new ways to preserve his memory. This essay demonstrates that in the memorial texts that spring up at the start of the twentieth century we find an obsessive focus on preserving the distinctive cadences of Wilde's speech transformed into an avant-garde response to critics and cultural commentators satisfied that Wilde's death meant that an unsavory voice would be heard from no more. Wilde's early biographers (including Robert Sherard, Andre Gide, Frank Harris, and Laurence Housman) borrow the haunting properties of the phonograph to invoke a dead voice whose very volubility dismantles a calcified generic aesthetic.

AB  - This essay examines the fiction and nonfiction in the +Birth Control Review= (+BCR=), a magazine Margaret Sanger edited between 1917 and 1929, to reveal a critique of aesthetic autonomy at the intersection of modernism and feminist politics. In contrast to the aesthetic autonomy espoused by Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot, the narratives in +BCR= depict autonomy as a ghastly punishment rather than a goal to be achieved. Such a reading offers a framework for understanding why the dominant rhetoric of the American birth control movement shifted - within only a decade - from feminist revolution to patriarchal eugenics.

AB  - In 1936, the American poet Muriel Rukeyser traveled to Spain to report on the People's Olympiad, an alternative to Hitler's Berlin games. Instead, she witnessed the outbreak of civil war. Rukeyser's writings on her experience span more than forty years, including a lost, unpublished novel, +Savage Coast=. Recently recovered from her archive, the novel is significant because it hybridizes the forms of aesthetic and political modernism and provides a more complex understanding of how women modernists write about politics and history through modes that both interrogate and transform the boundaries of genre.

Laski addresses the issues of wartime sexuality and infidelity with an ambivalence that parallels British anxieties about the changing roles of wartime women, and her project is successful because it runs counter to the wartime expectations for women that were much publicized in mass media and by government ministries that shaped both feminine standards of behavior and the limits of public tolerance for women who would flaunt those standards.

Focusing on Jean Rhys's +Voyage in the Dark= and +After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie=, I argue that Rhys's protagonists' failure to successfully enact prescribed gender roles is a feminist response, one articulated through a negative feminism rather than a conventional liberal feminism. Using Jack Halberstam's notion of shadow feminism and Sianne Ngai's noncathartic emotions, I show how Rhys exposes the need for an alternate model of white female respectability through her narratives of failure.

This essay uncovers how Dorothy Arzner, the only woman director of Hollywood sound film from 1928 to 1943, embeds responses to these critiques through what she calls 'unusual moments' in her films. In such moments, Arzner explores the possibility of an embodied modernist voice that is at once reflexive about technologies of mass culture and attentive to women's social and aesthetic concerns.

This article argues that +Zohra= works on two fronts, combining the private/personal and public/political: it critiques the systems of purdah and arranged marriage that shackle women in a secular nation desirous of modernity and insists on the rightful claims of Indian Muslims to belonging and citizenship in modern India (after Partition) on the basis of their anticolonial, anticommunalist struggles for social reform and national independence.

AB  - Jane Garrity's essay argues that Olive Moore's neglected masterpiece, +Spleen=, uses the idea of reproduction - both formally and thematically - as a metaphor and foundation for a completely new model of creative practice. Drawing from recent feminist theory on experimental literary form and from conceptual frameworks within disability studies, Garrity situates +Spleen='s preoccupation with pregnancy within the larger context of modernist cultural representations of disability, nonnormative sexuality, and racial science. The essay tracks the various ways that the novel is in effect an anatomy of the entrenched obstacles to women's creative agency in early-twentieth-century England.

AB  - This article articulates the significance of Persephone Books, an independent feminist publisher in London that recuperates lost modern writing. Persephone's 100 titles restore long-obscured continuities and connections in modern literature and arts; the unexpected success of this publishing venture illustrates modernism's continuing appeal to readers. The recuperative work of Persephone Books enables us to recast the modernist literary field so that we (1) understand canonical authors anew, (2) restore neglected authors to their places in modernist literary genealogy, and (3) further our understanding of modernist cultural production in the fields of literature, visual arts, textile and fashion design, and war propaganda.

Julie Otsuka's 2002 novel +When the Emperor Was Divine= subjects an unnamed, typical American family to military detention, evacuation, and forced incarceration. Compelled to identify with Enemy Japan, the members of the family transform into alien, treacherous beings. My reading focuses on small expressions of allegiance to Emperor Hirohito, who becomes a dangerous and tantalizing figure of desire in the novel.

Thus, if John Steinbeck's +The Grapes of Wrath= (1939) seems calculated to resonate with a white, middle-class audience, this is not because Steinbeck's humanism was covertly racist and bourgeois, but because he deliberately used humanism to correct readers' previously-held sympathies with racist and bourgeois ideologies.

AB  - This article analyzes fashion as a discursive force in Rosamond Lehmann's novel +Invitation to the Waltz=. Through a reading of Lehmann's novel alongside fashion magazines, it demonstrates that 1920s fashion, in spite of its carefully stylized public image as harbinger of modernity, was complicit in propagating patriarchal norms. However, if +Invitation= opposes the cultural machinery that regulates gender roles in post-war Britain, its formal appearance is nonetheless dependent on the very same tenets it criticizes since the novel reveals resemblances to Virginia Woolf's +To the Lighthouse=. If the tension between imitation and originality determines choices in sartorial fashions, female authorship in the inter-war period, this essay argues, was subjected to the same market forces that controlled and sustained the organization of the fashion industry.

Tracing a homology between a literal aerial perspective, a totalizing narrative voice, political propaganda, and despotism, this essay argues that Woolf embedded her critique of tyranny within the novel's form. With two narrative perspectives, the novel undercuts the allure of totalizing knowledge without itself propagandizing.

Rather than adding new fire to what is already an incendiary debate, this essay articulates the narrative, anthropological, and discursive forces that have the power to generate counternarratives that are almost the opposite, but not quite.

AB  - I argue that +Women in Love=, despite its air of apocalyptic defeatism, offers D. H. Lawrence's most intense engagement with the problem of how to imagine the future. Lawrence's tenuous hope for a world that does not repeat the oppressive patterns of normativity is communicated, surprisingly, through the figure of the couple - often a site of stinging critique for Lawrence - and ultimately hinges upon an unresolved tension between heterosexual and same-sex coupling. Far from being extinguished in the novel's pages, the project of creating a new future for the couple is passed along to the reader to pursue.

AB  - This essay argues that Octavia Butler's +Fledgling= traces, in the transformation of the protagonist Shori from mere +zoē= into +bíos=, the evolution of a posthumanist condition where vampires coevolve with humans. This occurs in three stages before climaxing in a posthumanist corporeality that involves a multispecies biological citizenship. Shori's biovalue and biological citizenship is at once corporeal and moral. Biovalue in Butler's posthumanist vision, I conclude, inheres in the moral enhancement of Shori and is the result of her multispecies citizenship.

AB  - Noting a recent critical trend to read contemporary fiction in terms of trauma theory, this article explores Ali Smith's +The Accidental= both as a negotiation and critique of this fashion. Recognizing trauma's centrality in the novel in terms of personal guilt and public catastrophe in relation to an implicit Iraq War background, I argue that the novel reaffirms trauma theory's importance, even as it criticizes post-9/11 appropriations of traumatic sentiment. By undermining romantic and patriarchal readings of trauma as the function of a state-of-alert, the novel satirizes salient post-9/11 discourses and reaffirms its final unease with trauma culture.

Through reading the anxieties about race, ethnicity, and science that permeate the novel in conjunction with the cybernetic term 'black box,' two things become evident. First, race and science become the primary categories through which the characters comprehend each other. Second, characteristics of those categories that are taken for granted, such as what constitutes Britishness in the 21st century, and the certainty of scientific evidence, actually destabilize the relationships they are intended to define.

AB  - John Burnside's prominence has arguably been achieved through his award-winning poetry rather than through his fiction. Indeed, his preoccupation with the numinous quality of ordinary environments seems most suitably articulated in lyric rather than narrative form. This article, however, reconsiders his virtuosity as a novelist, exploring the way +Glister= and +A Summer of Drowning= reinvigorate the practice of regional writing. Tracing Burnside's audacious strategies of ecological description, the essay charts his concern with reflecting on the political and phenomenological purposes of evoking natural landscapes together with the consolations that are generated by the act of evocation itself.

AB  - This essay explores the remainders of aesthetic modernism in the fiction and art of Tom McCarthy. Reading McCarthy as a media archaeologist of the modern, the essay places McCarthy's work in dialogue with recent scholarly approaches to modernist media environments. McCarthy understands modernism not as a repertoire of forms, or a utopian techno-poetics, but as confrontation between the noble subjectivity of the human and inhuman media. Recalling modernism's sustained attentiveness to the inhuman, McCarthy's paean to dirty media aligns his experimental work with the renewed prestige of certain strands of modernism in contemporary media theory.

AB  - In the last few years, Tom Mcarthy has launched a sustained campaign against the pieties of the traditional British novel. His debut novel +Remainder= sets out to debunk the conventions of trauma fiction, that, despite its emphasis on fragmentation, repetition, and temporal dislocation, often continues to rely on the conventions of psychological realism. In +Remainder=, trauma emerges not as a psychological event, but rather as an intractable, dysphoric, subjectless affect. Showing how trauma operates across the domains of the social, the somatic, and the psychological, the novel inaugurates a different account of the linkage of literature and trauma.

AB  - This essay examines Monica Ali's +Brick Lane='s tactics of cultural preservation, both dominant and minor, that routinely frame biologically inflected claims about migrant belonging in Britain. Working within and against theories of biopolitics, I trace how the novel is implicated in public discourses about the cultural demands of citizenship for migrants to Britain who are often mired in an irreducibly corporeal shadow language. Rather than social constructs, the uproar surrounding the publication of +Brick Lane= divulges the extent to which cultural claims about race, language, assimilation, and authenticity remain anchored in naturalized identity claims about what it means for former colonial migrants to belong in Britain today.

AB  - This article interrogates representations of time in the novels of Sam Taylor. Drawing on Ernst Bloch's utopian philosophical framework, I argue that Taylor's non-contemporaneous or 'metachronous' temporalities reconfigure narrative time within the broader context of increasingly post-secular questions of final judgment. Rather than recapitulating the 'Arcadian revenge' of SF ecocatastrophes, Taylor's nonanthropocentric glimpses of futurity enable us to move beyond the dichotomy of pastoral Arcadia/savage wilderness in twenty-first-century fiction. A comparative reading of Bloch's writings on natural futurity and Taylor's novels thus helps us reorient the theorization of temporality, suggesting new directions for post-apocalyptic, ecocritical, and utopian literary analysis.

AB  - This essay argues that the issue of what it means to live an authentic life in the twenty-first century has been a significant trope in recent British fiction. Negotiating between universalizing humanist perspectives and the radically individualizing politics of late-capitalist philosophy, Tom McCarthy's +Remainder= and Steven Hall's +The Raw Shark Texts= pose the question of whether any authenticity of the self can be imagined in an increasingly globalized, mediated, and digitalized world. Contextualizing these novels within contemporary British writing, this essay locates a profound psychological anxiety as the dominant mode for engaging with authentic subjectification.

AB  - This essay outlines the formal characteristics and critical relevance of the 'Multiple Drafts Novel,' a neuroscientifically-informed subgenre whose prominence is often obscured by the dominance of social and historical concerns in studies of contemporary British fiction. By reading a sequence of novels by Andrew Crumey, Tom McCarthy, and David Mitchell, alongside Daniel Dennett's Multiple Drafts model of consciousness, this essay argues that a cognitively-informed analysis of the contemporary novel not only can reformulate our understanding of specific novels, but also can provide new perspectives on problems inherent within critical construction of literary postmodernism.

AB  - In +A Mercy=, Morrison frames the psychic damage inflicted by slavery as a series of failed messages between slave mother and slave daughter. Florens's misreading of her mother's message, as she arranged for Florens's sale, becomes the distorting lens through which she perceives the world; and as a consequence of her separation from her mother, her capacity to read the meanings of others' messages is disabled. Jean Laplanche's theory of the enigmatic signifier, which also examines the effects of a parental message that cannot be understood, enables me to clarify some baffling aspects of Florens's actions and of her style as narrator. The narrative structure formally reproduces the thematics of mother-daughter separation.

AB  - This article examines how Patricia Grace uses the process of narrative adaptation as a way to meaningfully reinvigorate important cultural links between genealogy and geography in her 2004 novel +Tu=. This meticulously researched historical novel-about three brothers who enlist with the 28th 'Māori' Battalion in World War II-blends thematic and symbolic concepts drawn from Māori genealogical praxis (whakapapa) with events drawn from oral histories, newspaper reports, and personal journals. The result is a powerful transnational genealogical narrative that directly links political, cultural, and affective connections forged abroad to the ongoing development and rejuvenation of a dynamic local culture at home.

AB  - John Barth's short second novel +The End of the Road= acted as a sourcebook for his later ideas regarding the relation of art to morality in the context of the postwar cultural divide between modernism and mass culture. The narrator's paralysis in the face of practical life, and the therapies of 'motion' he adopts to traverse the mass cultural landscape, expressed the incommensurability of the aesthetic sphere with everyday life. The critical potential of Barth's emphasis on form is inseparable from the ambiguous figure of Jacob Horner, the narrator who lightens his moral commitments to others by claiming the aesthetic alibi.

AB  - This article examines Alejo Carpentier's novel +¡Écue-Yamba-Ó!= within the historical context of Pan Americanism, particularly the First Pan-American Conference on Eugenics held in Havana in 1927. The conference aimed to establish a set of criteria for identifying so-called degenerates throughout the hemisphere. But, while this was taking place, Carpentier was imprisoned in a nearby Havana jail, surrounded by the Afro Cubans who had been labeled degenerates and criminals by the Cuban state. I read +¡Écue-Yamba-Ó!= as a rebuttal to the eugenicists and the state since it presents a unified vision of black labor in the hemisphere.

AB  - In 1908 the novelist Flora Annie Steel turned her attention to historical fiction centered on the Mughal emperors. The first of these influential but critically neglected novels arrived just as Indian anticolonial terrorism had begun to incite drastic legislative powers of detention. Recasting the paradox of liberal imperialism in the form of Akbar's liberalizing impulse, Steel openly challenges the colonial rule of law. Prophetic of later British responses to mass nationalist mobilization, and in terms that closely anticipate Agamben's figure of +homo sacer=, the narrative endorses instead the grounds for a wholly modern and unobstructed form of sovereign violence.

AB  - In the wake of late-twentieth-century critiques of humanism in general and of human rights in particular, what basis remains for robust claims on behalf of the rights of humans? Through readings of work by Ishmael Bead, Dave Eggers, Helon Habila, and Chris Abani, this article suggests that a new generation of twenty-first-century authors have learned the lessons of those critiques but nevertheless refuse to abandon the human rights project altogether. Instead, each of these authors develops unique models of reference that struggle to overcome the impasse between universality and particularity that has historically plagued debates about human rights.

AB  - This article uses Donna Haraway's work in 'A Cyborg Manifesto' to examine how new reproductive technologies and politics meet and converge with fictional representations of the posthuman subject in Shelley Jackson's hypertext, +Patchwork Girl=. It argues that Jackson's text offers a cyborgian reading of reproduction that challenges the dominant discourse surrounding new reproductive technologies. Ultimately, it argues that Jackson's text represents assisted conceptions, cyborgian births, and monstrous progenesis in ways that explore the possibilities and limitations of the cyborg, and it addresses current preoccupations with the potential benefits and horrors of new reproductive technologies.

AB  - This essay examines how Nicholson Baker's +The Mezzanine= shifts engagement with the details of the material world consistently onto the axis of temporality. It also examines how, in so doing, Baker's novel fashions a theory of periodization in which historical and social trends and events are relegated in importance. Asking how the detail or moment might both alter an understanding of the general and spread time to infinite proportions, +The Mezzanine= casts doubt on the process of periodizing by way of metonymy and synecdoche and offers instead a contingent and improvised version of the 1980s.

AB  - This article aims to reimagine Jewish American literary history outside a nationalist framework that assumes Jewish American literature represents a recognizable historical subject. Free of the historicist expectation that its job is the coordination of literature with a historical Jewish subject, Jewish American literary history would not disregard the problem of identity, but would function as a counterdiscourse of identity. In this essay I focus on Abraham Cahan's 'The Imported Bridegroom,' which subverts the expectation of identity's self-evidence, making available a non-nationalist Jewish American literary history oriented not by recognition and continuity, but by desire and emergence.

AB  - This essay argues that William Faulkner's novel +As I Lay Dying= elucidates the political economies driving the illicit over-the-counter trade in birth control products during the 1910s and 1920s. Drawing on works such as Margaret Jarman Hagood's ethnographic studies of tenant farm women, advertisements for feminine hygiene products, and Margaret Sanger's political tracts, I read Faulkner's novel as staging - through the endeavours of Addie, Cora, and Dewey Dell - a series of failed rebellions against maternity that represent the real historical co-optation, by commercial interests, of women's radical demands for reproductive rights.

AB  - Kerouac's fiction echoes the discourse of delinquency that pervaded US social science in the 1950s. Like this discourse, Kerouac's work was an anxious inquiry into the psychological and cultural reasons behind certain Americans' failure to adapt to the United States' class structure. In texts like +On the Road, Maggie Cassidy=, and +Dr. Sax=, his autobiographical protagonists are alienated from the cultural attitudes of both the traditional working and new middle class. Prefiguring 1960s poverty theory, Kerouac depicts this in-between class status as the consequence of a deviant work ethic, passed on from inadequate fathers to their delinquent sons.

AB  - This article argues that post-Civil Rights 'Power literature' inspired a paradigm shift in the way separate group identities in the US could be politicized. Serving as an exemplary case, N. Scott Momaday's House Made of Dawn (1968) theorizes a politically viable sense of collective identity by emplotting alternate origin stories, or myths, through the controversial device of racial memory. The racial memory trope made mythic in House Made of Dawn demonstrates how Power literature partakes in universalist methods homologous with those of universalist midcentury mythologists. Yet it does so to further separatist political ends, thereby making such a seeming dissonance productive.

AB  - Despite James Baldwin's seeming antipathy towards sentimentalism, his novel +Another Country= reveals a profound investment in the political and aesthetic significance of authentic feeling. Mediating between the models of sympathetic identification found in Harriet Beecher Stowe's +Uncle Tom's Cabin= and Norman Mailer's 'The White Negro,' Baldwin articulates a model of sympathetic identification as a form of passivity in which we receive the experiences of another not by inhabiting other's bodies, but by allowing other bodies, and the pain those bodies have endured, to enter into our own.

Lawrence's +The Rainbow= from a Christian-humanist tradition sanctioned by a benevolent deity to a modernist culture, where new processes of individuation precipitate the breakup of communal values. In this transition, sacrificial activity undergoes dramatic transformations. From its source in direct contact with a God who rewards suffering with transcendent revelation for the first generation, it becomes secularized, sexualized, and increasingly violent. In the second and third generations, the animal-body that resists transfiguration is repeatedly subjected to symbolic disfiguration and death.

Turning to the works of Herbert Spencer, Henri Bergson, and late nineteenth-century naturalist and photographer P. H. Emerson, Saltz situates +The House of Mirth= in a turn-of-the-century dialogue about the subjective and idiosyncratic nature of human vision. Saltz argues that +The House of Mirth= makes a case for the visual education, and therefore evolution, of women like Lily Bart.

AB  - Humpty Dumpty began as a caricature of Charles I, the king toppled by Puritans. Lewis Carroll's better-known version moves the story of regime change to the scene of language, with Humpty's linguistic arrogance pitted against Alice's conventional view of language. Paul Auster recycles both figures, situating the egg in a site-specific American battle between the Puritan dream of a transparent language and the postmodern recognition of its impossibility. New York becomes the contemporary looking-glass stage for an allegorical struggle between incompatible language regimes, which is also a story about the dissolution of the Dumptyesque sovereign subject.

AB  - This comparison of protagonists in William Gibson's 'Johnny Mnemonic' and +Pattern Recognition= tests whether plot-driven fiction can produce only one type of literary subjectivity, or whether the subject can be successfully reimagined without abandoning the familiar narrative form. Contextualizing Gibson's fiction with Alan Turing's work on mathematical decidability, this essay explores the possibility of affecting radical change in understandings of identity while still appealing to a typical audience. Negotiating between the anti-sentimental modernist critique of personality and the democratic reach of conventional realism, Gibson's work culls out a positive direction for thought about the potential of posthuman ethics.

AB  - This essay employs Slavoj Žižek's elaborations of the Lacanian notion of ideological fantasy to analyze the political relationship of the people of Ruby, Oklahoma, to the outcast women of the Convent in Toni Morrison's +Paradise=. That relationship exemplifies the role of the other Žižek identifies in 'the conceptual Jew,' not the actually existing Jew but the fantasmatic image of the Jew of the anti–Semite. Addressing this image in the novel in terms of Žižek's concept of the parallax gap leads to the conclusion that Morrison's fictive world is as primordially divided as is Žižek's philosophical one.

This article further queries the marked absence of queer sexuality that Joey exhibits once he makes this final spatial transition, contextualizing this curious trajectory as part of a larger encrypted social context that problematically linked queer sexuality with the corruption of Marcos-era economic policy.

AB  - This essay focuses on James Weldon Johnson's overlapping literary and diplomatic careers. Johnson's novel +The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man=, written while he worked as a US consul in Latin America, draws upon tropes of international representation to weigh in upon questions of aesthetic and racial representation. Tracing Johnson's transition from a US representative abroad to a race representative within the US, the essay argues that Johnson's case illustrates the importance of permitting the significant tradition of black work in the US's diplomatic program to inform the ways we approach African America's expressive and geopolitical engagements with the international world.

AB  - The 1884 Prime Meridian Conference was a signal moment in the history of modernity, establishing a seamless space-time map and rendering the Greenwich Royal Observatory an international symbol of British imperial power. In this essay, I consider the representation of Greenwich Time at key moments in three canonical modernist texts: Joseph Conrad's +The Secret Agent=, James Joyce's +Ulysses=, and Virginia Woolf's +Mrs. Dalloway=. Exposing the linkage of Greenwich Mean Time to regimes of power, knowledge, and commerce, these modernists sought to dislocate narrative temporality from its enlistment in the imperial project of world standard time.

AB  - This essay focuses on twentieth-century Jewish immigrant author Anzia Yezierska's proto-feminism and how she employed the genre of the romance novel in order to promote new ideas about ethnic identity and female independence. A focal point is her relationship to the trope of the New Woman, especially through her 1923 novel +Salome of the Tenements=, a work that simultaneously incorporates fresh perspectives concerning popular genres, feminism, and sexuality.

AB  - +Abstract:= This article examines Mark Merlis's 1994 novel +American Studies= in order to analyze the performative potential of 'queer retrosexualities.' In re-visiting the history of the field through the fictional account of F. O. Matthiessen's life, Merlis's novel makes the 50s a primal scene of its narrative. By returning to the 50s, Merlis not only 'exposes' the heteronormative exclusions that informed the beginnings of American Studies, he also suggests how a different understanding of temporality could facilitate the creation of queer spaces within the practice of American Studies. I thus argue that the 'retrosexual' narrative of the novel thus perform a queering of the field of American Studies.

Reading Edmund White's coming out novel, +A Boy's Own Story=, in relation to a little-known work of gay pulp fiction, André Tellier's +Twilight Men=, the essay provides a fictional example of the ways white gay identities might be seen simultaneously to collude with and undermine the history of whiteness. The essay also elaborates a strategy for queer reading of the incoherencies of sexual identities within multiple historical discourses.

In this novel, Hemingway rewrites the pioneer as a sexually wounded veteran whose desire to transcend loss finds its material correspondent in objects that commemorate losses, not victories, and that embody and perpetuate national myth.

This essay, while acknowledging the importance of this relationship across the art forms, considers the importance of Flaubert's development of cinematographic techniques of writing as a crucial literary antecedent to Joyce's adoption and elaboration of such techniques. The essay considers Flaubert and Joyce's often analogous views of vision and photography and examines Joyce's attitudes to the cinema before looking in detail at examples from both authors' works which suggest an extensive technical intertextuality between the two +oeuvres=.

It argues that her depiction of Chinese-White marriage strategically redresses anxieties about black-white miscegenation that were fueled by Progressive and post-Reconstruction reform. While Sui Sin Far counters Chinese national exclusion by strategically pointing up the more offensive threat of black racial difference, she also exposes the disingenuous logic that attempted to situate national and racial exclusions on opposite sides of a hinge.

AB  - This essay focuses on two of Atwood’s fictions whose landscapes are haunted by US imperialism, +The Handmaid’s Tale= and the short story “Death by Landscape.” In both of these works, the landscapes illuminate victims of American imperial history by taking female characters hostage: in +The Handmaid’s Tale,= Offred is trapped within Gilead’s landscape, and in “Death by Landscape” Lucy vanishes in the landscape without a trace. Atwood’s containment of female bodies within these landscapes illustrates that understanding how identity and power are negotiated through landscape necessarily involves taking into account the gendered nature of landscape itself.

AB  - This essay applies Emmanuel Levinas's concept of the face of the Other, and of the command to ethical action emanating from that face, to literature of war. After brief discussion of several works of war literature, the focus turns to Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front. Levinas's ideas about face-to-face encounters are contrasted with Max Picard's. The conclusion considers where Levinas and Remarque diverge, arguing that although Remarque's novel leaves us with death in the foxhole, Levinas's philosophy points toward a path that might lead out of the trenches toward life, bringing us at last face-to-face with peace.

AB  - The focus of this article is Levinas's 'Exercises on 'The Madness of the Day'' in Proper Names and Blanchot's story, which is the subject of Levinas's reading. With reference to some of the writings by each of the authors, the problem of testimony and its limits is posed, in particular in relation to testifying to death or madness. What are Levinas's reading and Blanchot's story about? What differences in perspective can be emphasized? In what sense, in both approaches, is the point of the story elusive?

AB  - 'Beyond the Dialectic: Conrad, Levinas, and the Scene of Recognition' reads Conrad's Heart of Darkness through the ethical philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas. Focusing on two key scenes—Marlow's meetings with Kurtz and the Intended—the essay uses Levinas's work to highlight Conrad's attempts to move beyond the violence inherent in the Hegelian philosophical tradition, to a position of respect and responsibility for the other.

AB  - Paul Auster's ethical concerns have never been fully discussed because it is problematic to discuss concurrently his characters' unstable identities as a postmodern feature and their pursuit of responsibility for the other. Introducing the thought of Emmanuel Levinas that postmodern thought and ethics can be compatible, this paper explores Auster's ethical motif from the perspective of alterity, but not from the dialectical choice between the loss or the unity of identity. With specific attention to Levinas's ideas on certain physical dimensions and language, it first argues that the body's passivity constitutes ethical subjectivity in Auster's Moon Palace and finally suggests that 'incredible narrative' as a testimony works as an ethical demand in the novel.

AB  - The schlemiel is a central character in the tradition of Yiddish and Jewish-American literature. Oftentimes, the schlemiel is read as a comic character that has political and ethical content. In our essay, we take another look at the ethical character of the schlemiel by way of a close reading of Levinas's notion of the self, aesthetics, and ethics, coupled with Hommi Bhabba's reading of Levinas in terms of history and Adam Newton's reading of Levinas in terms of narrative. This nuanced reading is used in the analysis of schlemiels in selected stories and parables of Franz Kafka, I. B. Singer and Nathan Englander.

AB  - This essay reads the works of war journalists Michael Herr and Joe Sacco alongside Emmanuel Levinas's concepts of substitution, responsibility, and the 'hatefulness' of the self in order to draw out the political possibilities of Levinas's thought. Where Herr and Sacco posit responsibility and hatefulness as pre-existing, they grapple with the political practice of substitution. Most importantly, their writings draw out the limit case of the practice of substitution. The marking of their inevitable failure to substitute, however, poses a necessary critique of political, economic, and social structures that privilege some lives over others.

AB  - To observe that postcolonial studies as a field appears to be plagued by a guilty conscience—a persistent anxiety over its potential complicity with colonialism—is to state the obvious. Drawing on Emmanuel Levinas's philosophy, this essay exploits and extends this observation to argue that this guilty conscience reveals a largely overlooked ethical dimension in a field that derives its raison d'être from political, not ethical, concerns. Focusing on the concept of le regard, the essay suggests that Margaret Atwood's Bodily Harm offers an exemplary dramatization of such a guilty conscience, simultaneously revealing le regard's complicity with colonial violence and its ethical interruption.

AB  - This essay intervenes in recent critical discussions of Elizabeth Bowen's literary writing by surveying her literary and social criticism. Bowen's literary values are grounded in a combination of Victorian and modernist aesthetics, described as the 'impersonal personal.' Bowen presciently examines realism's ability to foreground the linkage between power and interpersonal feeling, and she exhorts contemporary writers to realize this potential through the detached representation of personal experience. Bowen's eclectic literary values reflect ambivalence about the relation between literary production and the pressures of the market, and she views the feminine voice as a source of meliorative political and artistic possibilities.

Seven Winters is also a meditation on the development of subjectivity within a specific historical and cultural context, charting the development of a writerly sensibility and this aspect of the text can also shed new light on the rest of her oeuvre.

After the destruction of World War II, she began to question her reasons for trusting in her earlier intuitions about the non-human realm and the epistemological premises that informed her literary sensibilities. In essays and radio broadcasts from the post-war period, and in her later fiction, she interrogated these notions, uncovering key complexities in her point of view concerning the inanimate.

AB  - Within the last twenty years, precipitous declines in fertility have begun to reverse the population explosion. Women's access to contraception, education, and employment is reflected in the falling birthrate, and even in Ireland the single-child family is an expanding demographic group. Yet despite the advantages for working women and the health of the planet, having or being an only child is still perceived as a misfortune. Sociologists contend that only children are no more lonely or selfish than their peers, but they cannot shake the old diagnosis: 'Being an only child is a disease in itself.' In this paper I analyze Elizabeth Bowen's literary representations of the only child, showing how she negotiates negative popular stereotypes through gendered aesthetic techniques. I argue that in Bowen's first three novels, The Hotel, The Last September, and Friends and Relations, onliness is the driving force of her creative process: it shapes her characterization and her formal structures, governs her choice of modernist high-cultural allusions, and, most importantly, enables her exploration of unstable gender identities and queer sexualities.

AB  - This essay argues that The Last September generates both historical meaning and stylistic originality by taking apart the basic progressive structure of the Bildungsroman. While Bowen may have imbued the novel's autumnal scene with a certain wistful appreciation for the civilization of the Anglo-Irish, the novel's plot, language, and characterization in fact tend to encode a deeper and more systematic narrative meaning in which the frozen, virginal fate of Lois Farquar indexes the structural contradictions of settler colonialism and the larger inevitabilities of postcolonial nationalism.

AB  - Critics interested in viewing Bowen from a perspective other than that of mannered social realism have frequently resorted to suggesting points of similarity between her work and that of her fellow Irish Protestant writer, Samuel Beckett. This essay takes a survey of these suggested affinities as its starting point, and uses them as a basis for a comparison between Bowen's petrified ingénues and Beckett's moribunds, their shared interest in inertia, waiting and ritual, an imagery of ruination and syntactically contorted English, and an investment in cultural dislocation linked by many commentators to their shared lack of the 'credentials' of Irishness.

AB  - This essay argues that Don DeLillo's 2003 novel Cosmopolis presents a critique of the world of cyber capital that invokes and is framed by the long-standing Euro-American republican contrast of virtue and corruption. As always in such discourse, corruption endangers the republic, but in the increasingly mediated reality of the kosmou polites, the traditional counterweight of virtue is left with no ground on which to stand. DeLillo's book thereby takes a political turn, evoking, in the manner of the Menippean satire, a fantastical, dream-like vision of both individual and political illness.

AB  - Alice Randall's novel +The Wind Done Gone, =a parodic revision of Margaret Mitchell's +Gone with the Wind=, has been billed as a work of revisionist history that challenges familiar notions about life on plantations. Yet its use of a fictive source and its therapeutic ethos suggest that it may be more accurately described as an example of what Teresa L. Ebert has called 'ludic' postmodernism—a mode of thinking whose privileging of difference and performativity offers psychological satisfactions at the expense of a truer and more transformative history.

AB  - Zulfikar Ghose's critical reception has focused on the relationship between authorial biography and authenticity. +The Triple Mirror of the Self= (1992) refracts this focus, and can be read as the author's interested response to his own exclusion from emerging canons of postcolonial literature. The novel depicts the relationship between postcolonial textual production and Anglo-American reception in a way that emphasizes how its parameters exclude Ghose's own works. It then stages the author's rejection of the expectation that he will act as an interpreter of an authenticated location related to the place of his birth.

AB  - In three short stories—'Propaganda by Monuments,' 'The WHITES ONLY Bench,' and 'Courage'—and in his novel +The Restless Supermarket=, Ivan Vladislavic dramatizes the problems facing South African culture in its attempts to memorialize a violent and traumatic past. These texts suggest a skepticism about the capacity of monuments and memorials to convey an authentic past. +Restless Supermarket= in particular reveals the complex ways in which memory and consciousness are mapped onto space and place in the aftermath of apartheid, and explores the spatio-temporal implications of postmodern 'urban palimpsests' for the inscription of memory and identity.

AB  - The question 'How should we talk about abortion?' drives two of the most popular fictional abortion narratives of the 1920s: Ernest Hemingway's now canonical 'Hills Like White Elephants' (1927) and Viña Delmar's once best-selling novel +Bad Girl= (1928). In both, a crisis of communication organizes a crisis of reproduction as the characters' emotionally awkward speech forestalls the realization of the modern nuclear family. As these works propose, modernism's impersonal aesthetic ideal is modernity's domestic disaster, and so diagnosed, they seek an alternative literary performance that would transform their New Women into New Mothers and their modernist Bad-Boys into All-American Dads.

AB  - Anne Michaels's +Fugitive Pieces= diverges from earlier literature of the Holocaust in its engagement with the pastoral tradition. While the pastoral had been appropriated by the Nazis as part of their Blood and Soil ideology, Michaels reclaims and revises the pastoral and its sister genre, the elegy. She creates a traumatic pastoral focused on geological cataclysm and redefines Blood and Soil through images of soil soaked with blood. Michaels allows an anthropomorphized nature to grieve, but by presenting images of infertility rather than fertility she refuses the traditional compensatory apparatus of the elegy.

AB  - This paper argues that Carole Maso's novel +AVA= demands to be read not only as an instance of +ecriture feminine= but also as a piece of post-Holocaust literature. This reading refocuses attention on one of the novel's major themes and helps to rethink the contested category of post-Holocaust fiction itself. +AVA= demonstrates the profound effect the Holocaust has had on American art since the end of World War II, illustrating the extent to which the terms 'postmodern' and 'post-Holocaust' have become synonymous. It also contributes to an understanding of contemporary American cultural production as melancholic.

AB  - This paper demonstrates how in his graphic novel In the Shadow of No Towers Art Spiegelman reads the events of 9/11 through the conceptual screen of the Holocaust. The questions that are raised in this connection concern the legitimacy of speaking about catastrophes, the stylistic means necessary to avoid sensationalism and kitsch, and finally the role of political commitment in the process of mourning or working-through.

AB  - Recently Marianne Hirsch has argued it is necessary to think anew about words and images and their expressivity in the specific cultural and historical context of the 'war on terror'. Here Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis and Art Speigelman's In the Shadow of No Towers are read in terms of 'autographics': the distinctive technology and aesthetics of life narrative that emerges in the comics. Unique mediations of cultural difference occur in the grammar of comics, which make demands on the reader to navigate across gutters and frames, and shuttle between words and images, in an active process of imaginative engagement with others.

AB  - Lynda Barry's 'autobiofictionalography' One! Hundred! Demons! (2002) and Marjane Satrapi's memoir Persepolis (2004) recast the visual and narrative conventions of comics to provide critical commentary on issues ranging from the social construction of gender to the forces subtending forms of prejudice. The works literally as well as figuratively draw out the ways in which the transition from childhood to adulthood becomes overdetermined by narratives of development that set gendered roles, articulate racial demarcations, inscribe religious differences, and authorize imperialist vision; they also highlight the ways in which figures resist, subvert, and capitulate to forces of social coercion and normative visions.

AB  - This article, a study of the Milestone Media graphic novel Icon: A Hero's Welcome, argues that African-American graphic novels are an important literary forum for black women's voices. I examine the ways in which Rocket, Icon's female narrator, revises the conventions of both the slave narrative and the conventional superhero comic story in order to locate black women within the American histories from which they traditionally have been absent. Rocket, sidekick to the superhero Icon, both helps her alien counterpart to assimilate into a black male identity and rewrites their adventures together to reflect her own process of self-discovery.

AB  - This essay examines McSweeney's Quarterly Concern Number Thirteen, edited by Chris Ware, and its use of intimacy, shame, and gender melancholy to make a case for the artistic merit of comics. Through readings of contributions to the issue by artists such as Lynda Barry, Ivan Brunetti, Charles Burns, Joe Matt, John Porcellino, Archer Prewitt, and Chris Ware, the essay finds that the McSweeney's comics issue interpellates readers through 'comic shame' and uses modernist tropes to establish comics as high art. Affect is central to contemporary independent comics and the readerly participation they elicit.

AB  - Focusing on the unique architecture of comics, in which panels are both sequenced linearly and meaningfully juxtaposed on a two-dimensional page, this essay explores Chris Ware's use of two- and three-dimensional narrative strategies to complicate linear understandings of narrative structure. In Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth, Ware employs such multidimensional narrative strategies to effectively thematize the novel's engagement with issues of narrative time, circularity, and continuity, as well as to call into question the very notion of a 'narrative line.'

AB  - This article challenges the strong presumption that narrative, capable as it is of expression in different media, is constituted by a medium-independent content. It draws upon Neil Gaiman's Sandman comics series in order to interrogate the role of the medium in narrative, and the foundational narrative concept of the event, and elaborates a concept of narrative as a cognitive faculty. This approach to narrative facilitates a rhetorical model of its medium-contingency, and occasions an exploration of the narrative quality of dreams, which emerge as proto-fictions, and as the paradigm for a rhetoric-driven model of fictionality.

AB  - In adapting Paul Auster's postmodern detective story City of Glass as a graphic novel, Paul Karasik and David Mazzucchelli succeeded in producing a visual translation of an often non-visual text. Focussing on Auster's text rather than Auster's story, it is argued, the artists make inventive use of visual metaphors, visual styles, and comic conventions to translate Auster's words into pictures. The text's investigation into, and interrogation of, language is brought to bear on the comic version's own visual language, and City of Glass: The Graphic Novel emerges as valuable source material for a future poetics of comics.

AB  - Jem Cohen's film Lost Book Found and Ben Katchor's comic strip Julius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer theorize American memory and urban decay. In moving images and sequential panels respectively, Cohen and Katchor comment on melancholy, nostalgia, commodity fetishism, and the meanings extracted from physical objects and lived space. Their works of cinema and graphic art draw attention to urban shopping centers, the repetitious work of salespeople in those ritualized environments, and the mass public's transitory consumer experiences. This essay examines Cohen's and Katchor's work in light of Walter Benjamin's historical materialist criticism.

AB  - This essay explores the way in which Marilyn French's The Women's Room and Marge Piercy's Vida work to imagine feminist futures despite a conviction of totalized domination that results in what the author terms static time.While debates regarding totalization have been considered primarily in terms of contemporary theory, this essay argues that such novels' relentless depictions of women's absolute oppression operated as a means of thinking through the post-1960s sense that 'the System' had triumphed, demolishing revolutionary futurity. Feminist novels thus became a key arena for both the inscription of and the resistance to static time.

AB  - Does fiction function as archive or as repertoire? Diana Taylor's distinction between these two modes of memory fails to fully explore fictional attempts to capture a repertoire of performance within the archival page, while Toni Morrison's Song of Solomon, Janet Frame's The Carpathians, and Jose Saramago's All the Names posit the novel as a site where repertoires of embodied knowledge can be captured within the literary archive, producing memory as a powerful presence by interring its mediated images within the silent page. A comparison of these novels suggests the richly paradoxical relationships among fiction, cultural performance, and memory.

Theories of abstraction and of comedy are implicated in these fictions as means to a primary end: the replacement of empathetic response with an 'anesthesia of the heart.'

To do so, it charts how Cather's men refuse the movement from friendship to homosexuality in order to wreck the designs of a legible sexual history, and to fracture the historical march from passionate same-sex friendship to urban gay subculture. Focusing on The Professor's House, it views these deliberate failures of sexual expression as beneficial outcomes of her regional male bonds.

AB  - This essay, situated within the theoretical framework authorizing the juxtaposed readings of African-American and white women writers, interrogates the narrative methods by which Virginia Woolf and Toni Morrison incorporate their readers in the search for understanding in To the Lighthouse and Jazz. Using dislocations in time and space, free indirect discourse, polyphonic narrative voices, and skeins of freighted images, these texts problematize memory, history and knowledge. Because sites of narration are mystified and perhaps unreliable, readers are encouraged to become co-creators of the narratives by interpreting the submerged and difficult histories that that have shaped characters and circumstances.

AB  - Using Jacques Lacan's arguments about the gaze, this essay examines the dialectic of looking and being looked at that runs through Marlow's tale in Heart of Darkness. The scenes of looking often contain ideological symptoms of colonialist voyeurism, in their repeated emphasis on intrusive and yet thwarted vision. The scenes of being looked at frequently produce sensations of 'scotomization': a term I borrow from Lacan to describe experiences when the human subject feels reduced, imagines himself as insignificant, invisible even—transformed into a dark spot or scotoma in the visual field. The scotomization of Marlow 's European I/eye during the river trek, in particular, suggests his precarious mastery over the foreign region he visually explores. The larger trajectory of Marlow's tale, I argue, ultimately reveals a visual sublimation, as it turns from physical sights that are threatening, inscrutable, or fascinating toward the metaphysical insight purportedly provided—through vicarious vision—by Kurtz.

AB  - This article argues for a radical reassessment of J.M. Coetzee's novel Foe, claiming that the novel's current critical oeuvre duplicates rather than critiques universalizing discursive practices. In particular, it suggests that the critical assumption that Friday lacks a tongue results from a too-ready recourse to the established critical templates of postcolonial (and, to a lesser extent, feminist) discourse. These templates make it difficult to entertain ideas outside of their own methodologies and assumptions. The article recognizes that Friday may well have a tongue, and offers a provisional re-reading of Friday's silence as an act of wilful restraint and defiance rather than as the straightforward result of an act of physical mutilation.

AB  - Han Ong's Fixer Chao revises our understanding of ethnic and cultural mimicry by representing two versions of Feng Shui. On the one hand, the gay Filipino protagonist poses as a Feng Shui master in order to cheat and undermine his rich Manhattanite class enemies. Nevertheless, the environmental alterations he enacts have material and social consequences, and indicate the need for rethinking mimicry not only as a mode of subversion, but also in terms of spatial practices, affective loyalties, and geographical flows.

AB  - The culminating vision and transformative power of Pat Barker's The Ghost Road are produced by the cross-cultural insights embedded in the novel's critically neglected Melanesian material. It is through W. H. R. Rivers's repeated wartime memories and dreams about his 1908 expedition to Melanesia to study primitive kinship relationships as a medical anthropologist that he ironically comes to understand the barbaric elements of his own inculcated ideology of British manhood, war and civilization. Rivers's dreams of Melanesia enact and ultimately help him resolve his increasing ambivalence about his institutional role as military psychologist and state advocate for the war effort.

AB  - Kundera's Slowness subjects to critique Western media's efforts to police Eastern Europe's communist histories into teleologies of democracy, capitalism, and universal human rights. Slowness highlights these histories' reification through reductive images as it rethinks the very notion of history. Arguing that no historical narrative can disclose past 'truths,' Slowness resorts to fragmented images of communism, employing the media logic against itself to expose its ideological role in the production of historical master-narratives marketed to vast audiences. While Slowness' communist remembrance cannot access past 'truths,' it can expose its own marginalization in the present, fruitfully haunting the teleology of globalization.

AB  - Satire reemerges in modernism because it offers an escape from coercive identifications enacted through sentimentality. As seen in the fiction of Nathanael West, however, satire's rejection of sentiment runs significant risks, threatening to dismiss the acutely felt claims of a suffering public. West's novels thus describe and negotiate a rift between satire and sentiment, between irony and pity, between aesthetics and ethics. In its antisentimental impulse, satire renders the human subject mechanical, insensate, or unable to experience emotion at all, yet this reductive, grotesque vision elicits an uncanny dread that paradoxically reaffirms feeling as a basis for aesthetics.

AB  - This article examines the narrative and political functions of illness in Zona Gale's 1923 novel Faint Perfume. Responding to representations of the female invalid in nineteenth-century domestic fiction, Gale challenges interpretations of the New Woman figure as a corrective to Victorian paradigms of feminine frailty and confinement. Through not only her protagonist's response to illness but also her novel's silences surrounding pain, Gale complicates pathologized notions of femininity by depicting the struggle to resist them. Faint Perfume emerges as a neuritic novel, one whose narrative muscles flare under the strain of political and cultural burden.

AB  - While critics such as Orlando Patterson have defined slavery as anathema to kinship, this essay argues that kinship is often invested in violent claims of possession and ownership. Turning to Toni Morrison's Beloved, I contend that the novel's critical reception has tended to disavow this violence by framing Sethe's infanticidal act within an idealized conception of maternal love. Contrasting Sethe with the historical figure of Margaret Garner—the mulata fugitive slave upon whom Morrison loosely based her novel—I ask why racial mixture is both ubiquitous in Beloved yet absent from Sethe's family lineage, and conclude that this exclusion of miscegenation works to redouble the novel's already idealized conception of maternal love.

Exemplifying Morrison's thesis that remembering slavery can mollify its unhealed wounds, the music and libretto invert the racial roles of her novel Beloved, with which it shares historical source material. The score reinforces the motif of memory by engaging with Scots-Irish songs, Britten's Peter Grimes, Bernstein's West Side Story, and other music. A synopsis of the opera is included.

The railroad holler 'Sis Joe,' whose lyrics are sung by Paul D, offers insight into her revisionary project. Originally performed by African-American song leader Henry Truvillion and immortalized in a ballet by Aaron Copland, 'Sis Joe' provides Morrison with the opportunity to recover the black contribution to U.S. culture and history, and to illustrate the interdependence between blackness and whiteness in American identity.

AB  - Toni Morrison's Jazz represents a significant intervention into an ongoing Black cultural discourse in which the terms blues and jazz are ideologically freighted. Morrison's novel evokes many of the controversies of the Black Aesthetic movement, in which blues was widely regarded as an artifact of an abjured Southern past, and jazz was viewed as an expression of urban-revolutionary modernism. Morrision revisits this argument by placing it in the context of the Black urban diaspora of the early 20th Century, troubling the boundaries between blues and jazz, cultural tradition and innovation, and vernacular and commodity culture.

AB  - A decade's worth of criticism lauds Beloved for mourning the trauma of American slavery. However, much of this criticism is limited by the boundaries of trauma-theory. Alternatively, an analysis of property-rights in Beloved, focusing on the legal problem of 'claiming,' demonstrates that claiming is an act of psychical self-possession as well as a formal demand for property rights. Claiming property presupposes but also produces the individual freedom of the one making the claim. We may therefore read Beloved as creating an imperative case for reparations for slavery and Jim Crow segregation, drawing on theories of liberal justice and reconciliation.

AB  - Drawing on Beloved, Jazz, and Paradise, and offering a close reading of Love, this essay explores how Toni Morrison's later fiction interrogates conceptions of justice that rely on a logic of commensurability (i.e., punishment equal to the crime, redress adequate to the injury, and benefit corresponding to the desert). Commensurability-based notions of justice risk replicating slavery's logic of commodification, Morrison's fiction suggests, by reifying both victims and perpetrators as abstract categories, placeholders in a symbolic exchange, or fungible elements of an equation.

AB  - This essay looks at Toni Morrison's Tar Baby through the lens of black diaspora theory to uncover its gendered critique of black nationalism. Further, it suggests that Morrison uses two distinct modes - myth and realism — to construct two different representations of diaspora. While the conception of diaspora at the mythic level affirms unity, the representation of diaspora at the realist level makes apparent the fact of fracture. In this way, even as Morrison provides us with an injunction to revere tradition, she simultaneously deconstructs the basis for articulating a stable vision of what such tradition might look like.

AB  - Even though no lynchings take place in Toni Morrison's Sula (1973), the novel borrows from and rearranges actions and objects typically found in lynching narratives. This article examines how Sula combines the lynching narrative's primary signifiers with the traumatic returns of African American soldiers from the battlefields of World War I. Using a historical materialist approach, the author argues that Sula's soldiers dramatize, sometimes directly, and sometimes abstractly, the psychological intensities and traumas specific to the public, black male body between the war years.

AB  - This article examines Winfrey's book club discussion of Toni Morrison's Paradise in order to identify various continuities and gaps between the aspirations of serious literature and the inclinations of middlebrow readers. Many of Winfrey's audience members complain about the text's inaccessibility, thus casting doubt upon Morrison's purported aim: to redefine paradise as a state of inclusivity. Nevertheless, even as they contest the novel's literary value, the participants engage in just the sort of egalitarian and rigorous conversation Morrison sees as an indispensable part of any constructive utopian politics.

AB  - This article examines the critique of communal politics of life in Paradise focusing upon the two tropes through which Morrison dramatizes the frictions of such politics. On the one hand, she re-invokes the Exodus-trope of African American national politics for her critique of Ruby's racist and patriarchal 'covenant of life.' On the other hand, she puts forward an Anti-Exodus trope through which, in her sections on the Convent women's practice of everyday life, Patricia Best's use of countermemory, and Piedade's songs, she explores some of the possibilities and risks of a cross-racial, women-centered, and transnational politics of life.

AB  - This essay compares Morrison's Paradise and Wicomb's David's Story to explore corresponding machinations of memory operating in both novels' featured communities of resistance. Tracing the ways in which women and memory figure as potential threats to stabilized order and established truth, this essay argues that the management of collective memory peculiarly resembles the containment of women in racialized societies, the United States and South Africa. This observation about what is called 'loose memory' alerts us to the dangers of foundationalist regimes of Truth and Reality. It also points to alternative, 'loosening' narrative strategies that Morrison's and Wicomb's novels model.

AB  - This essay explores black class privilege and associated questions of skin color and racial authenticity in Toni Morrison's 1997 novel, Paradise, written during a period fraught with intraracial ambivalence and confusion about what it means to be 'black' in the post-Civil Rights era. In their obsession with biological racial purity, Morrison's '8-rock' characters corporealize racial authenticity, a concept that usually exists for African Americans as a cultural ideal. Paradise ultimately critiques the black nationalist desire for a 'pure,' and purely 'authentic,' form of African American identity, in the process highlighting the frequent suppression of the multiracial in authenticity discourse.

AB  - This essay considers the Jewish and/or Yiddish presence within the debates around art and politics that underlie the development of modernism, particularly in the United States. To do so, it focuses on the figure of Emma Goldman, whose work and life played out the debate, often in the Yiddish language. Particular attention is given to parallel texts in Yiddish and English that address the topic of art and politics. Goldman is brought into view both for what she can offer to a more expansive understanding of the modernist movement and, as the essay suggests, for the resonance with the current discussions of ethics and aesthetics that she and her anarchist cohort provide.

AB  - In contrast with other Jewish modernists, Gertrude Stein's relationship to Jewish concerns has been, until recently, little explored. No one has yet examined Stein's curious relationship to the Zionist movement or the text she wrote in response to Zionism's political agenda after World War I. Through a close reading of 'The Reverie of the Zionist' (1920), this essay examines Stein's political and aesthetic response to Zionism. It places this response in a historical context, looking at Stein's personal ties to Zionism. It also considers the ways in which 'Reverie' anticipates Stein's later ideas about nationalism and 'the Jews' during the 1930s.

AB  - This essay analyzes images of blackness in Anzia Yezierska's novels and short stories. Instead of viewing Yezierska within the confines of immigrant writing, it situates her within the context of concurrent movements in black American literature. By placing Yezierska within the historical milieu of the Jazz Age and Harlem Renaissance, it argues that these images of blackness, including references to jazz, mark her protagonists' ambivalence about assimilation. It thus explores how Yezierska's writing expresses a model of cultural hybridity by symbolically addressing the dialectic of black and white—a strategy reflected in her protagonists' attempts to model hybrid selves.

AB  - This essay examines Abraham Cahan's 1917 classic novel The Rise of David Levinsky through the lens of queer theory. The article suggests that Levinsky may be read as a queer character whose homoerotic desires must be suppressed as being incompatible with the larger project of Jewish American assimilation that Cahan's text is invested in. Focusing on how David carefully constructs his own persona via narration to establish himself as a masculine heterosexual American man, the essay highlights the power that compulsory heterosexuality exerts over the formation of David's identity and situates that force opposite multiple moments of queer desire that pervade the narrative.

AB  - This essay examines the racialized and gendered construction of Jewishness in Edith Wharton's The House of Mirth. Through an analysis of the depiction of Simon Rosedale, the Jewish parvenu who unsuccessfully woos Lily Bart, I contend that Wharton's perception of Jewish difference is more complex than it initially appears, making reductive conclusions regarding her antisemitism impossible. However, uncovering Wharton's ambivalence makes her repudiation of Jewish difference all the more striking; although Wharton grudgingly acknowledged that upwardly mobile immigrant Jews like Rosedale had become part of her world, she would never fully accept that they were there to stay.

AB  - The article examines Joseph Roth's ambivalent attitude toward Jewish assimilation in Hiob and related works. In Hiob, the motor behind Jewish assimilation is figured as both an inexplicable Jewish Wandertrieb and an excessive attraction of Jewish women to Gentile men. Drawing on post-Freudian psychoanalytic theories and sociocultural studies, including Daniel Boyarin's Unheroic Conduct, I explore the implications of this eroticization of a social process. While Roth tends to blame the destruction of Jewish tradition on Jewish women, his notion of an 'assimilatory drive' also allows for a productive reengagement with the concept of assimilation.

AB  - This essay introduces readers to Mina Loy's unpublished novel Goy Israels, written in the 1930s, an autobiographical portrait of a young half-Jewish half-English artist and writer. The novel draws on sources as diverse as its protagonist, from contemporary racialist scientism to John Bunyan. Loy considered her self-portraits to be part of the modernist impulse to make it new and this one melds science and art, autobiography and experimentation, allegory and ethnography. Feinstein argues that Loy pioneers complex narrative forms in Goy Israels to reflect and better understand the complexities of human nature—especially the enigmatic aspects of modern Jewish identity.

AB  - This essay examines Djuna Barnes's transformation of the figure of the Jew in Nightwood from a racial and religious category into a narratological category. I argue that this transformation loosens Jewishness from Nightwood's actual Jewish characters, establishing a paradoxical equivalence between the statements 'Jewishness is everywhere' and 'Jews are nowhere,' a paradox that is crucial to the structure of Nightwood itself. Drawing on letters that Barnes wrote to her friend and fellow writer, Emily Coleman, I show how this alteration reflects a complex convergence between essentialist and anti-essentialist conceptions of Jews in Barnes's work, and in modernism more generally.

AB  - Rereading literary histories from the vantage point of the Lower East Side foregrounds the unacknowledged power of immigrant culture-makers and of Yiddishkeit institutions as a shaping force in the creation of an American cultural response to the challenges of modernity. Abraham Cahan's short fiction in English limns the paradox for the immigrant intellectual whose engagements with 'native' culture are both socially transformative and invisible. In these texts, we can read an allegory of the Yiddish-language intellectual, laboring at the birth of alternative modernisms, in a history of mutual borrowings that has never been fully translated or recorded.

AB  - This article examines the philosophical paradoxes of African negritude, as they determine and are scrutinized in the novel L'aventure ambiguë (1961). The primary means by which this narrative interrogates the logic of negritude is through the re-inscription of racial dialectics as an opposition between two 'logi': the word of French modernity against the word of African Islam. To interrupt the irresolvable contest between Africa and Europe that initiates negritude, Kane portrays Islam as a cultural presence in Francophone Africa that is as significant as 'blackness' and 'whiteness,' but which identifies with neither. With its tragic ending and persistent tone of elegy, L'aventure ambiguë can be seen as negritude's swansong, even as it offers the most sophisticated exposition of negritude values anywhere in the African novel.

AB  - Drawing from archival documentation of their long-standing literary relationship, this essay examines the correspondences between the negritude writings of Léopold Sédar Senghor and the assimilationist thought of his literary precursor René Maran. It traces the history of Senghorian negritude as a theory of cultural intermixture or métissage. As Fabre demonstrates, Senghor's ideas about the ethical and political significance of cultural hybridity, which emerged from his intellectual relations with transnational black figures of the 1920s and 1930s, aimed to counter biologically-rooted forms of racial essentialism with a notion of blackness—what Senghor referred to as the 'black soul'—considered as a set of cultural properties.

AB  - The 'Gibson Affair' marked the height of Cold War paranoia that came to consume the group of black expatriates centered in Paris in the 1950s. In writing of the forgeries and surrounding events that bear his name, Richard Gibson argues that the economy of the scandal was determined as much by the question of political commitment to Algerian independence as it was to the question of affiliations to the United States and its government. The essay combines Gibson's informative memoir with a meditation upon Richard Wright's unpublished roman-a-clef (and only novel set in Paris), Island of Hallucination.

AB  - Richard Wright articulated a political theory that reflected his engagements with both negritude and existentialism, while effectively challenging their ideological limitations. In his novel The Outsider, Wright critiques the Communist Party's racialized deployment of the strategy/tactic paradigm. The rigor of Wright's critique uncovers the structures of universalism and particularism as fundamental to Western political ontology, leading directly to a corresponding critique of Heideggerian existentialism. Opposed to any politics of authenticity, Wright proposes a politics of the outside which calls for a reconfiguration of the political structures of representation.

AB  - The frequent critical evocation of expatriate novelist Chester Himes as an icon of social realist protest in 20th century African American literature has the customary effect of obliterating exactly those questions of poetic figurality by which his complex themes are able to surface so jarringly. This essay explores several of Himes' writings, investigating operations of tonality and timbre in their linguistic fabric. It argues that the darkly ironic opacity that characterizes much of what is unique about Himes as an artist also performs an unrelentingly sharp critique of the crass racialism, identity gamesmanship and commercialism that so pervasively defines his U.S.—doing so in ways that conceptually outstrip the flatly oppositional idioms of social realism to which his work is so often assigned.

AB  - This interdisciplinary study incorporates a literary reading of Nella Larsen's Quicksand (1928) with a cultural history of Baker's cinematic celebrity in order to reconsider celebratory narratives of the St. Louis native's success in Paris. Did she transcend stereotypes of black womanhood or was she enmeshed in their discursive net? Analyzing Baker's dancing and film roles through Larsen's conception of exoticism, migration, bodily representation and cultural hybridity reveals the complications assembled in this dancer's seemingly transparent stardom and recasts her as an informed Black modernist.

Although the two authors did not meet in interwar Paris, the resonance between their work demonstrates that the fruits of transatlantic artistic exchange between African diasporic writers stem not only from actual moments of encounter, but also from the circulation of ideas.

AB  - France became configured as a space and a cultural apparatus of democracy and 'color-blindness' by African American writers around World War I. W.E.B. Du Bois, Addie Hunton, and Gwendolyn Bennett identified French as replete with a democratic consciousness, and suggested learning French thereby challenges the racialized body politic of the U.SA. Despite the limited and strategic value of this position, as recognised by Rudolph Fisher and evident when juxtaposed to French colonial policy, the essay argues that France's role as a polemical lever for civil rights struggle in the U.S.A. is an important legacy for the New Negro Renaissance.

AB  - Two new critical books that focus on gender and science provide an opportunity to reflect on how far science-fiction criticism has developed in the last decade. Justine Larbalestier's The Battle of Sexes in Science Fiction and Brian Attebury's Decoding Gender in Science Fiction demonstrate a level of sophistication and complexity that reveal it is difficult to discuss science fiction without addressing gender issues. The appearance of these two books suggests the importance and marketability of science-fiction criticism and science fiction itself to redefinitions of modern fiction.

AB  - The essay looks at possible areas of intersection between postcolonial criticism and ecocriticism, two relatively recent critical schools that, despite their obvious differences, share similar concerns with social justice and transformation. Via readings of three recent texts by Arundhati Roy, J. M. Coetzee, and Barbara Gowdy, the essay argues that postcolonial criticism and ecocriticism exist in part as mutual correctives: postcolonial criticism to the culture-blindness of certain strands of ecocriticism, and ecocriticism to the anthropocentric tendencies of postcolonial thought.

AB  - Atwood's The Blind Assassin has to do with memory as retro- spection, temporality being figured spatio-materially, with the emphasis on vision. In attempting to 'fix' time through an obsessive elaboration of material objects, the novel foregrounds the lure and deception of the visual, the way images, like symbols, function, to stand in for what isn't there. Images of duplicity or doubling, encapsulated in the photo of the two often indistinguishable sisters, torn in half, suggest a return to that moment of simultaneous self-identity and self-alienation in the mirror, described by Lacan as a violent 'tearing' between self and other, a perpetual (self-)assassination.

Based on the argument that Gravity's Rainbow is an historical novel, this essay shows how Pynchon in this novel stages the conflict between elect and preterit, between nature and technology, between historical human agency and grace by embedding its themes within the specificity in Central Europe at the end of World War II.

Specifically, the essay explores the ways in which Rhys turns Ford into a transitional object in her fiction in order to free herself from his dominant role in her life and fiction. The essay also explores the generic complexities of Rhys's negotiation of autobiographical and fictional materials as she attempts to develop and utilize psychological insight about her own dependency on Ford in order to achieve literary freedom for herself.

AB  - In this essay, I argue that Oscar Wilde's trip through the 'ruined' South reinforced his nascent preoccupation with the relationship between beauty and decay, a preoccupation that informed his most iconic creation, Dorian Gray: the beautiful aristocrat in whom physical decline and Aestheticism merge. I argue that Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890) is a novel whose gothicism was in part born of the same aesthetics of ruin as William Faulkner's Absalom, Absalom! (1936), and demonstrate that in Wildean dandyism (as expressed through both Wilde's self-aestheticization and his prose) Faulkner recognized a model through which to critique the multiple and contradictory performances of Southern aristocracy. By first directly invoking Wilde and then reworking the temptation scene in Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890), Faulkner reinterprets dandyism for the South­­casting the dandy as a culturally-perceived monster who registers the threat that miscegenation and deviant sexuality pose to the postbellum South.

AB  - This essay examines how Elizabeth Robins borrowed from the theater to fashion new forms of modern identities for women. Robins combines melodramatic and burlesque performance genres in ways that alter the conventions of realist narrative and prefigure the cosmopolitan, fluid subjectivities of high modernism. Ranging from anti- and pro-British women's suffrage rhetoric to emergent forms of leisure activities and crowd theories, this essay contextualizes the problems, fears, and advantages of cross-class identifications. While Robins ultimately contains these sexualized, working-class energies, she nonetheless documents a powerful critique of middle-class forms of subjectivity and knowledge that imagines a leveling of class hierarchies.

AB  - In its descriptions of a quest for an idyllic Thai lagoon, The Beach creates a romantic portrait of a space seemingly untouched by the homogenizing effects of consumption. As the novel develops, however, it becomes increasingly clear that this escapist dream is unsustainable. Starting with the recognition that Garland's characters find themselves reproducing the world they intended to leave behind, this essay considers the implications The Beach raises for the analysis of relationships between consumerism and escapism, and reflects upon the critical possibilities generated by the novel's representation of globalization.

AB  - The books under review here study how certain Anglo-European and African-American writers in the twentieth century have appropriated and revised the narrative patterns and symbols associated with the dominant cultural imaginary of the American frontier and West. Instead of regeneration through violence, scenes of alienated domesticity and violence in western literary marriages from Wister through Didion, William Handley argues, represent 'the degenerative sign of a failed project of national union and identity' (231). Michael Johnson shows how a range of African-American male and female writers interweave, adapt and revise both EuroAmerican (frontier narrative) and African-American (slave narrative) literary forms to explore themes of racial freedom and oppression and the construction of masculine identity. Both books exemplify the newer field imaginary of western American literary studies emerging during the past few years.

AB  - Faulkner's Sanctuary compulsively revisits and refashions a centerpiece of Freudian thought, the primal scene, an image out of the unconscious mind for the origin of identity and the cultural order. As construed by Freud, the primal scene becomes a dramatization of his theory of male identity-formation in castration anxiety; that is, the primal scene poses the castration threat that causes the boy to turn away from his mother and subordinate himself to his father. Faulkner's inscriptions of the primal scene dismantle Freud's image of the invincible father and reveal that a model of identity-formation based in repression is its own undoing.

AB  - Through a reading of his fictional account of the Harlem race riot of 1943 that serves as the closing scenes of Invisible Man, this essay delineates Ellison's racial philosophy, a rubric as much an expression of black nationalism as it is the formation of an ethical system for human interaction and accountability. It is a reading, though, that necessarily traces Ellison's racially gendered critique of the State and its domestic colonial practices, and the (unevenly) shared psychological consequences of American racial violence on the public sphere. And, in its end, this essay maps the connection Ellison makes between racial injury and the possibility of black patriotism.

AB  - Focusing on James's account of New York in the 1850s from A Small Boy and Others, this essay argues that, despite his clear antipathy toward the 'modern' New York he describes in The American Scene, his own memories of an 'old' New York involve a much more varied and pleasurable response to the city itself. Indeed, James's nostalgia for the city of his childhood reflects a prior modernity marked everywhere by media (dioramas, panoramas, posters) and spectacle (melodramas, theatrical displays, the Barnum Museum)—a modernity whose 'visibility,' for James, has been 'smothered' but not lost.

AB  - This article explores the viability of the tropes of trauma and mourning in Samuel Beckett's Texts for Nothing. Beckett's work decomposes the initial premise of trauma and mourning: the idea of the subject within history. Texts for Nothing places the narrator in a timeless space, a space beyond history. Mourning presupposes a subject within history, a subject able to contain his or her trauma within a narrative, historical, frame. Because Texts for Nothing offers itself as a dismantling of narrative, these thirteen texts function as a critique of mourning and as a critique of the very idea of trauma.

AB  - This essay focuses on conceptualizations of space in Leslie Marmon Silko's novel Almanac of the Dead. Specifically, it seeks to understand how constructions of geographic scale contribute to both the survival and overthrow of colonialist-capitalism. In its critique of colonialist-capitalist enterprise, the novel elucidates how scale operates as a mechanism for place-making, profit-making, and identity-making, processes linked to economic globalization and social reproduction. In addition, other stories manipulate and/or resist conceptions of scale. Through these stories, the novel re-envisions the idea of scale with a Native American conceptualization of space and narrative modeled on expansiveness rather than expansion.

AB  - Mason & Dixon's examination of America's origins is informed by a dual temporal perspective: that of the late eighteenth century during which the modern nation-state was conceived and the late twentieth century in which a globalized economy and rise of huge conglomerates have led critics to proclaim the era of the nation-state as over. With New World slavery jettisoning all notions of American exceptionalism, colonial faction preventing national consolidation, and the very shape of the earth making the actuality of America impossible to determine with any fixity, establishing what is American becomes an act of representation. Pynchon portrays that act as less a function of politics, as the colonists demanded, and more a question of aesthetics, as the pictorial mapping in which his surveyors engage illustrates.

AB  - This essay argues that Woolf's engagement with the war's legacy prompted her to represent a new kind of mourning practice, one that spurns consolation and closure. In critiquing the consoling rhetoric of God, king, and country, Jacob's Room articulates a politics and ethics of mourning linked to Woolf'sfeminist aims. To the Lighthouse turns the question of consolation back upon Woolf's own medium, showing how a female painter deconstructs the notion of redemptive art and represents a perpetual mourning of loss.

AB  - Within a theoretical framework linking Julia Kristeva's subject-in-process to the ethical philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas, this paper links the novel's metaphor of subjectivity to language, history and social convention through a reading of the character Bernard. It highlights the symbolic nature of totality as expressed in Bernard's narrative, with language, history and convention grouped together as the home of the singular self, and the decentering of this self achieved through the problematization of representation, teleology and social structures. Associated questions of the violence and ethics of representation, subjectivity and the writer's task are also addressed.

AB  - This article takes up the connection between feminist ethics and aesthetics through the example of Virginia Woolf's work. It argues for a feminist model of ethics posed between radical alterity and its seeming opposite, the ethics of care, by way of the Deleuzean figure of the fold. In Woolf's work we can see public ethical and political responsibility arise from private moments of eros or care. Woolf's writings bring the epistemological and the ethical into conversation with each other, using aesthetics to make an ethical realm­­or a fold­­between the potentially universal and the personal.

AB  - Woolf's reading of Tolstoy in her roles as critic, translator, and novelist, is set in the context of discourse about the nation. The Modernist structure of Mrs. Dalloway suggests that as a novelist Woolf challenged Arnold's and Lubbock's readings of Tolstoy, which as a reviewer of Russian fiction she had at first shared. The most telling result of her reading may be traced in the composition of The Years. Like War and Peace it was to represent the family in the context of wartime representations of national history. The incomplete sentence, by means of which speakers of different national languages may create a single syntax, tropes translation as potential communication beyond the bounds of family, class, and nation.

AB  - In Orlando: A Biography, Virginia Woolf substantiates continuity in Orlando's transhistorical, transgender character through national identity. Through her emphasis on Orlando's elemental relationship to national space and poetic entrenchment in a national literature, though, Woolf reveals Englishness to be composed of exclusions as well as inclusions. She thus illustrates the extent to which national identity is haunted by what she might have called 'invisible presences' that inhabit the nation not as subjects and citizens, but as ghosts. Woolf works out her conflicted stance on national identity through hauntings insofar as she builds silences and absences into her narrative of Orlando's Englishness.

Examining her visit to the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley (1924-25) alongside Mrs. Dalloway (1925), I argue that Woolf's novel can be seen as an aesthetic and a political response to the representational dilemmas involved with bringing the empire home and the difficult task of translating global space into local space.

AB  - Wide-ranging aesthetic and political racialisms inform Virginia Woolf's narrative technique in To the Lighthouse (1927), producing radical departures from literary tradition. In dismantling patriarchy's social and novelistic conventions, To the Lighthouse extends the English formalist doctrines that lauded autotelic art-forms from East Asia, Africa, and South America. The novel's narrative fluidity and abstraction re-invent the racial philosophies of Roger Fry's formalist tract Vision and Design (1920), as well as the racially marked modernité of the Omega Workshops' art-objects. The well-known feminist politics and formalist aesthetics that answer this novel's questions depend on the often-overlooked narrative position of racial identity.

AB  - Virginia Woolf's shorter fiction is a critically neglected field. Class is the determining factor that influences how women occupy private and public space and articulate desire in Woolf's 1906-41 shorter fiction. Drawing upon published and unpublished holograph and typescript drafts in The Monks House Papers as well as the Berg Collection, this new reading establishes the oscillating patterns of elision, idealization and contempt that mark stagings of working-class and lesbian bodies and desires in Woolf's prototypical shorter fiction including 'The Watering Place' and 'The Ladies Lavatory.'

AB  - This essay addresses the implications of Margaret Thatcher's explicit criticism of Bloomsbury in her memoir, The Path to Power. Thatcher and Woolf circulate as icons of opposing cultural politics in a struggle that has persisted from the 1920s until now. Woolf's attitudes to middlebrow culture, exemplified by the representation of London suburbs in her writings, are antagonistic to Thatcherite thinking, a worldview that holds sway not only in critical attitudes to Woolf and Bloomsbury but also in the public posture of American politicians. Woolf's attitudes to class form a resistance to such postures.

Woolf draws us into a tingling, Brownian zone of encounter and registers the aesthetic, ontological, and ethical force of encounter in that zone. The essays chosen for the issue treat not only the sexual, economic, national, and imperial dimensions of Woolf's rendering of these encounters but also, by way of such philosophers as Emmanuel Levinas, the ethical dimensions.

It explores representations of miscegenation, and links between miscegenation and 'racechange', in South African English novels of this period, including Perceval Gibbon's Souls in Bondage and Margaret Harding, William Plomer's Turbott Wolfe, Peter Abrahams's The Path of Thunder, and particularly Sarah Gertrude Millin's God's Stepchildren. It reads these novels as developing a stock theme in South African literature, and as exemplary of the interplay between history, ethics, and aesthetics in the genre of the novel.

AB  - This study examines Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of the 'Superman' detective Sherlock Holmes, and his anxieties of race detection. Experiencing a racial crisis upon meeting Henry Highland Garnet, a former African American abolitionist, I argue that Doyle's failure and anxiety in detecting race and his consequent popularization of detective fiction (which, significantly, utilizes an 'exact science' of detection) reveal that the emergence of the detective fiction genre is in direct response to the threat of racial passing. This is further evidenced through 'The Yellow Face,' a story of race passing in which Holmes is confronted with one of his rare cases of failed detection. As a result, I show that the fear of 'racechange' witnessed in both Doyle's life and fiction emphasizes that one cannot look at the politics of passing without a wider examination into the genre of detection.

AB  - The racechanges in Jack Kerouac's fiction originate in racial fetishism. Kerouac's arrested Oedipal narratives and his related myth of Native Canadian ancestry lead to ambivalent identifications with black subjects, who exhibit characteristics that more properly belong to Kerouac's mother. These identifications exhibit a fetishistic play of presence and absence. Accordingly, Kerouac's racechanges are unstable formations designed to consolidate an ethnic minority writer's American national identity, his autochthonous link to a gendered landscape and his volatile sexuality. When Kerouac's fiction is read in 'translation,' his joual mother-tongue dramatises a psychosexual crisis in national belonging.

The primitive serves as a space of self-creation and exploration for Hemingway from his youthful association of the primitive with (re)creation and transgression to its role as a figurative home amidst the alienation of modern culture. Focusing on his African safaris, the article suggests that while his interest in primitivism reveals Hemingway's longing for authenticity and origins, his racechanges and intimate identification with the primitive ultimately create an awareness of the hybridity and performativity of identity.

AB  - The category of black humor has a racial resonance when applied to American fiction of the 1960s. A recurrent object of critical interest in this body of comic writing was the function of 'blackness' in the formation of 'white' identities. In Bruce Jay Friedman's 'Black Angels' and Terry Southern's 'Twirlin' At Ole Miss' desperate individuals are shown negotiating their sense of self in ambivalent exchanges with an imaginary other. Thomas Pynchon, in 'The Secret Integration,' analyzes an adolescent act of imitation across racial lines as an effort to overcome socially prescribed differences. And in 'Lost in the Funhouse,' John Barth locates racialized fantasy as a constitutive element of sexual maturation.

AB  - This essay argues that The Great Gatsby may be fruitfully read against African American models of identity formation of the late teens and Twenties. Like Gatsby, passing and Americanization fiction render racial and national identity theatrical. Gatsby's parties, given minimal attention in Fitzgerald scholarship, miniaturize the process of identity formation that characterizes the novel as a whole. Theatrical modes of identity formation are not limited to the novel's parvenus, however: showing how even the novel's elite are fully implicated in the culture of imitation, Fitzgerald refutes the possibility of any identity as 'the real thing.'

AB  - Investigating the figure of the queer black dandy in the art and literature of the Harlem Renaissance, this article argues that African American modernists such as Wallace Thurman and Richard Bruce Nugent revise nineteenth-century, European models of dandyism and decadence in order to critique the cult of authenticity surrounding the cultural construction of blackness. Their rebellion against the commodification of black identity gives birth to a new aesthetic that combines the naturalized simplicity and vigor of primitivism with the artifice of decadenceÐmaking legible a distinctly African American incarnation of the new forms of desire, identity, and community emerging in modern, urban culture.

AB  - Recent critical history has seen renewed interest in theorizing the ethics attributed to literature. What such interests mean for reading drives the argument of this essay, which contends that an ethics of literature emerges out of the reading problems posed by Toni Morrison's Beloved and Sula. Centered on protagonists whose narratives defy communal as well as literary convention, Beloved and Sula compel readings insistent in their efforts to delineate resolution. Yet in their ceaseless provocation of reading both novels demand that judgments be made even as they suspend the determination of such judgments.

AB  - This essay examines how in The Long Dream (1958) Wright portrays the developing consciousness of a man torn between filial allegiance to his black father and social subservience to white patriarchal authority figures. Recognizing Wright's interest in Freudian and Marxist theories, I argue that Wright uses this father-son relationship to explore the psychological and economic effects of racialized patriarchy in twentieth-century America. Wright's protagonist derives from his father an understanding of his own social illegitimacy, but he also inherits from his father both material and symbolic means by which to challenge this racist social order.

AB  - My analysis of A Long Way from Home (1937) subjects the memoir's closeted narrative to a poem collected in one of McKay's first publications, Constab Ballads (1912) as well as passages from his novel Home to Harlem (1928). A Long Way from Home takes steps to suppress its queer voice and proletarian presence. Though shadowy, such imprints may be traced-despite McKay's care in suppressing the entangled presences of 'the love that dare not speak its name' and his onetime persistent dedication to Communism.

AB  - In this essay I argue that The Custom of the Country (1913) is less a novel about divorce or the invasion of New York by the nouveau riche than an exploration of the impact of unprecedented fungibility and commodification of property on personal identity. Wharton articulates her sense of the consequences of changing property relations in the text not only in terms of the constitutive relationships between persons and (often family) property but also in terms of competing vocabularies.

AB  - Olson evaluates James's complex conception of race in The Golden Bowl, specifically focusing on Fanny Assingham, a pivotal character at the fulcrum of the novel's action. Olson shows how Fanny is allied with the Jewish characters in the novel both physically and functionally, arguing that Fanny's Jewishness is signaled by her behavior, not by fixed or innate qualities. Moreover, Fanny contests and diminishes authorial control, even as she amplifies our sense of the author's presence. This dual function is constitutive, in the novel's terms, of her Jewishness, suggesting a bracing self-identification on James's part with this same figure.

AB  - Allan Pinkerton was both the architect of the first national detective agency and author of a series of extremely successful post-Civil War memoirs narrating the activities of his agency. After working as a Pinkerton Agent for almost seven years, Dashiell Hammett consciously intervened on the narrative tradition of Allan Pinkerton with a series of detective fictions critical of the detective's visual authority. Considered together, the work of Pinkerton and Hammett enact a visual and epistemological drama fundamental to the emergence of modernism in America.

AB  - Cormac McCarthy's novels are usually seen as belonging to one of two longstanding regionalist literary traditions, Southern Gothic or the Western. This essay considers McCarthy's border fiction instead as part of an emergent borderlands discourse that is at once bilingual, multicultural, and revisionist. Blood Meridian and All the Pretty Horses represent key moments in the history of the Southwest region in which they are set; both novels in effect remember the dis(re)membered bodies lost in the violent struggle over territory. McCarthy's border fiction challenges provincial models of US literary history and ought to be reconsidered within postnationalist American studies.

AB  - At what point do identity tropes turn into their negative counterpartÑstereotypes? How much identity is too much? These are the questions at the heart of Gayl Jones's most recent novel Mosquito, which explores the line between racial characterization and racial stereotyping, specifically in terms of African-American configurations of latinidad. Jones blurs the boundaries between orality and literacy, stereotypes and (round) characters by producing a novel that is a form of textual verbalization, where literate habits of reading are challenged through oral modalities of (flat) characterization and storytelling.

Comparing two 19th century novels, one Cuban and one US, that draw on a 1844 Cuban slave uprising, Gillman examines the political and cultural work slave revolts do in different national contexts. The essay also discusses the reception of Helen Hunt Jackson and Harriet Beecher Stowe by the Latin American intellectuals José Martí and Roberto Fernández Retamar, a revisioning that transforms these novelist from examples of an undervalued literature of women's sentimental reform to central texts of Our American literature.

AB  - How can we map the Americas in our age of globalization as a cohesive but complexly differentiated space? How can literary and cultural studies become less state-centric? John Rechy's The Miraculous Day of Amalia Gómez and the songs of the Mexican Elvis, El Vez, provide insight into these issues. The diverse cultural discourses signified upon in these works reflect the embeddedness of the subaltern subject in a variety of cultural discourses and material practices produced by the flows of global capital. They think beyond the state and thus suggest the need to re-imagine the borders of trans-American cultural studies.

AB  - This article explores the question of how to rethink both the substance and methodology of teaching US literature, with an eye toward college-level survey courses. To reimagine this field, it draws from the critical vision of nineteenth-century commentator José Martí. The article argues for a reflexive understanding of the contradictions in US society and the ideologies informing the categorization of literature as 'American.' It concludes with an examination of how foregrounding specifically political and ideological concerns within texts can contribute to an understanding of aesthetic value, rather than detracting from it.
