TI  - A Submergent Imaginary: The Radical Ecology of J. G. Ballard's The Drowned World
AU  - Rae, Allan
T2  - Paradoxa: Studies in World Literary Genres
AB  - This article examines J. G. Ballard's The Drowned World (1962), focusing on its imagination of watery submergence as a vehicle for interrogating problematic boundaries of subject and ecology. In this article I claim that the text encodes the figure of submergence as both a manifest, representable narrative experience, and as a kind of latent structural logic which explains the entanglement of human and nonhuman at a material level. This reading builds upon recent work on the novel, and more generally of Ballard's oeuvre, which figures it as proto-cli-fi, suggesting that it is a text which both predicts and responds to questions of human finitude and ecological imbrication raised by the Anthropocene era. The article engages with the philosophy of Timothy Morton to show how the novel places stable notions of anthropocentric mastery of environment under question, and analyses the aesthetic strategies employed by Ballard in order to do so, suggesting that he depicts ambiguous bodily and ecological limits and disturbing presences in ways which accord to the modes of "weird," "eerie," and the "uncanny" as defined by Mark Fisher. Ballard's submergent imaginary describes an active ecological space which repeatedly revokes anthropocentric frameworks of comprehension and thus engages with problems of spatial and temporal scale in a manner which has been thus far radically under-theorised.

TI  - An Ethics Beyond: Posthumanist Animal Encounters and Variable Kindness in the Fiction of George Saunders
AU  - Kaiser, Kevin Richard
T2  - Biblioteca Javier Coy d'Estudis Nord-Americans: 153
AB  - This study examines the fiction of contemporary American author George Saunders in terms of how it presents situations applicable to the chief notions of posthumanist ethics and how these conceptions concern nonhuman animals, which are prevalent in his writing. Posthumanist ethics can help us understand what is at play in Saunders’s fiction. Meanwhile, his texts can help us understand what is at stake in posthumanist ethics. This interdisciplinary project may be beneficial both to conceiving new notions of ethics that are more inclusive and, more implicitly, to understanding the relevance of Saunders’s fiction to the current American sociocultural climate.

TI  - Atmospheric Exceptionalism in Jane Eyre: Charlotte Brontë's Weather Wisdom
AU  - Pizzo, Justine
T2  - PMLA: Publications of the Modern Language Association of America
AB  - As her family name suggests, Jane Eyre is exceptionally responsive to changes in the weather. In her eponymous “autobiography,” Jane’s ability to predict future events and assume an embodied—yet occasionally omniscient—insight alerts us to the ways in which Charlotte Brontë’s fiction leverages the rise of climate science as a basis for successful female authorship. In opposition to the prevailing belief of the Victorian medical establishment that storms prompted hysteria and exacerbated symptoms of women’s biological “periodicity,” Brontë’s first published novel draws the sensitive body and insightful mind of its female protagonist into close alliance. Far from reflecting a nervous pathology, Jane’s empowered responses to the air demonstrate the ways in which meteorological concepts such as weather wisdom and lunarism prove vital to nineteenth-century fiction.

TI  - Beauty That Must Die: Station Eleven, Climate Change Fiction, and the Life of Form
AU  - Vermeulen, Pieter
T2  - Studies in the Novel
AB  - While most discussions of climate change fiction tend to focus on genres and objects, this essay foregrounds the importance of the notion of form. Starting from an understanding of the Anthropocene as marked by the entanglement of particular (social, cultural, symbolic) forms of life and (biological) life forms, the essay argues that literature’s “life of form” can productively engage the complexities of those interactions. Indeed, if philosophical discussions of Anthropocene life such as Samuel Scheffler’s Death and the Afterlife and Roy Scranton’s Learning to Die in the Anthropocene suffer from a confusion of life forms and forms of life, a novel like Emily St. John Mandel’s Station Eleven is more canny about their multifarious interactions. Ultimately, and in contrast to most post-catastrophe fiction, Mandel’s novel is less interested in the specter of the end of the human species than in the fundamental contingency of all human forms of life. The essay draws on Eric Santner’s work in political theology and on Station Eleven’s intertextual usage of the work of William Shakespeare and Herman Melville to present an account of the multifarious interactions between life and form that are at stake in climate change fiction.

TI  - Ben Lerner’s 10:04 and Climate Change
AU  - Klaces, Caleb
T2  - Textual Practice
AB  - This article shows how the formal tactics of Ben Lerner’s hybrid novel, 10:04, respond to climate change. The article reads two related aspects of the text – its foregrounding of the medium and its use of appropriated images and poetry – in terms of their negotiation of a realist literary space which Amitav Ghosh has argued precludes engagement with extreme, unpredictable weather events. By focussing attention on aspects of a literary text typically overlooked in literary discussions of contemporary ecological issues, the article helps extend the purview of what it might mean for a novel to engage with a climate in crisis. This expanded understanding of engagement contributes both to the ongoing, collective exploration of contemporary climate change fiction and to the stock of critical tools with which to interpret it.

TI  - British Climate Fiction and Will Self’s The Book of Dave
AU  - Arvay, Emily
T2  - English Studies: A Journal of English Language and Literature
AB  - This article proceeds from the premise that the early 2000s saw an increasing number of British authors deploy double-mapping techniques to concretise the supranational scope of advanced climate change. Along these lines, this article suggests that Will Self’s The Book of Dave (2006) epitomises a subgenre of contemporary climate fiction – one that maps an inverted historical referent onto a seemingly speculative future in order to transport the reader to a state of imagined obsolescence. More specifically, Self’s semi-submerged Hampstead Heath distils over two-hundred years of history on the remote island Hiort into a period of fourteen to foreground the implosive tendencies of closed geopolitical systems sustained by transhistorical reiterations of power. At heart, this article asserts that Self cloaks recorded history in defamiliarizing devices to critique present-day petroleum dependency as propelled by ideological rigidity, historical distortion, and cynical opportunism as much as corpocratic encapsulation and environmental precarity.

TI  - Climate Change on Cardboard: Ecological Eurogames
AU  - Makai, Péter Kristóf
T2  - Paradoxa: Studies in World Literary Genres
AB  - This article examines how climate change has been simulated in modern hobby boardgaming. It argues that, like other playful media, board games are an important vehicle for the communication of the scientific principles behind climate change because learning and applying the rules of the game imply a tacit acceptance of the logic of climate change, and the players' agency activate problem-solving skills that highlight the social and political aspects of climate change action. In this article I investigate four board games, 20th Century, C02: Second Chance, Rescue Polar Bears: Data and Temperature, and Keep Cool, including modifications to the original rules of C02, to demonstrate the wealth and breadth of representing how human actions factor into the current climate crisis. Methodologically, I merge theories from game studies and science communication to highlight how playful mechanisms can elucidate the abstract, sometimes barely perceptible changes of the climate to lay players.

TI  - Contemporary Fiction vs. the Challenge of Imagining the Timescale of Climate Change
AU  - Mertens, Mahlu

T2  - Studies in the Novel
AB  - Fiction writers who try to do justice to the vast temporal and spatial scales and the enormous complexity of climate change are faced with the problem that the phenomenon exceeds human perception and that it is not dramatic in the traditional sense. In this article we explore the formal challenges that arise when fiction takes on the temporality of climate change by examining three very different novels that seek to capture the geological timescale. We analyze Richard McGuire’s time-bending graphic novel Here (2014), Dale Pendell’s fictional future history The Great Bay (2010), and Jeanette Winterson’s cautionary science-fiction tale The Stone Gods (2007) through the lens of Barbara Adam’s concept of the timescape, Rob Nixon’s idea of slow violence, and Timothy Clark’s notion of destructive doubles to see what kinds of literary innovations and translations the timescale of climate change has provoked. In doing so, we ponder Clark’s question, posed in his recent book Ecocriticism on the Edge: The Anthropocene as a Threshold Concept (2015), whether humans are constitutionally incapable of imagining the Anthropocene—the new geological epoch defined by the action of humans of which climate change is the most salient manifestation—or whether authors can adequately depict and convey it by disrupting conventional modes of representation. We conclude that while each of the three novels ultimately falls short in this regard, collectively they do chart possible pathways for successful literary treatment of the most pressing ecological threat of our time.

TI  - Crises of Water and the New Maps to Utopia
AU  - Popov, Alexander

T2  - Paradoxa: Studies in World Literary Genres
AB  - Following Kim Stanley Robinson, we use the Greimasian semiotic square to enlarge the meaning of utopia beyond the binary opposition with its contrary: dystopia. This article explores all ten generic terms generated by the discovery procedure, but we focus most of our attention on that which is the negation of utopia's negation: anti-anti- utopia. We argue that this final term mobilizes the totality of the semiotic structure and thus embodies utopia as an open-ended process of mapping possible futures. This formal analysis leads us to two main theoretical conclusions: anti-anti-utopia means a radical enlargement of the notion of subjecthood, and to an engagement with spatially heterogeneous worlds. In order to explore the constraints of the model and to situate them within the material-semiotic medium of water, we read two recent climate fictions along with contemporary ethnographic work which highlight the political potential of emergent waterworlds. The Water Knife in which Paolo Bacigalupi presents a future of extreme drought in North America. It taunts the reader with glimpses of utopian possibility at the level of individual characters, feinting toward critical dystopia, but such hopes are ultimately neutralized by the anti-utopian barrier of capitalist realism and the inhuman infrastructure of manmade atopia. In the second waterworld explored here, Kim Stanley Robinson's flood novel New York 2140, water crises play the opposite function: facilitating the construction of a new imaginary, of an urban matrix of fluid situations that catalyzes the struggle for the right to the city and counters the combined and uneven disaster capitalism. Anti-anti- utopia, in the semiotic mesh, emerges as a utopia-by-necessity, a revolution predicated on care for others. It inscribes in itself a dynamic and critical interplay of all other utopian forms and thus completes the map of utopian genres that we propose in this article. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AU  - Morgan, Glyn
T2  - Paradoxa: Studies in World Literary Genres
AB  - Plastics are a ubiquitous and highly useful material which has become inextricably linked to modern lifestyles. With decomposition times longer than the lifespans of some human cultures, plastics are also a key part of our environmental legacy and a visceral and visual marker of the petrochemical industry's impact on the world. In this article I investigate the manner in which plastics are visualised in often overlooked comic book and graphic novel forms by examining Nick Hayes's, Rime of the Modern Mariner (2011), Joe Harris and Martin Morazzo's Great Pacific (2013) and Richard McGuire's Here (2014) with comparisons to William Gibson's non-graphic novel The Peripheral (2014). Through examinations of plastic waste, each text draws out our anthropogenic impact on the planet as the legacy of imperial and capitalist projects. By using the genre of SF these authors and artists are able to examine the relationship of plastics to death, extinction, and yet also to permanence and immutability: projecting narratives thousands of years into the future to examine the legacy of the human race.

AU  - Garforth, Lisa
T2  - Osiris
AB  - Postwar environmental concern has been powerfully shaped by projections of ecological catastrophe. Indeed, it can be said that the global environment as an object of social and political concern came into existence in part through narratives of future crisis. This article explores two successive framings of environmental crisis and the kinds of knowledges that made them up. It examines the announcement of ecological limits to economic growth in the early 1970s, the culmination of an early wave of popular green concern that modeled the future as a choice between the catastrophic continuation of business as usual and the prospect of eco-utopian alternatives. It considers the crisis logics of contemporary climate dynamics, where the power of scientific modeling leaves little room for the imagination of radically different futures. Environmental crisis now cannot perform the anticipatory and utopian functions that it once did. The apocalyptic horizon of limits has given way to the collapse of crisis into the present and new kinds of colonization of the future. But in both cases, environmental crisis can be read as a science-fictional object, simultaneously descriptive and speculative, scientific and fictional. Science fiction tropes were crucial to early constructions of environmental crisis, and speculative climate fiction will be a vital resource for negotiating the social-natural futures of the Anthropocene.

TI  - From the Grotesque to Nuclear-Age Precedents: The Modes and Meanings of Cli-Fi Humor
AU  - Traub, Courtney
T2  - Studies in the Novel
AB  - In a New York Times review of MaddAddam, the final instalment in Margaret Atwood’s eco-apocalyptic trilogy, Andrew Sean Greer notes “[w]hat a joy it is to see…Atwood taking such delicious pleasure in the end of the world.” If critics such as Timothy Morton and Michael Branch have lamented the dominance of elegiac, melancholic rhetoric in ecological writing and (in the case of Branch) pleaded for more humor in both literary theory and practice, this article unearths how humor operates on crucial rhetorical and narrative levels in the climate fiction of Atwood and Ian McEwan. It analyzes how several comic modes—from satirical dark humor to slapstick—draw attention to ethical and epistemological quandaries raised by climate change and ecological risk in distinctive ways that merit further study. Drawing historical and generic comparisons to satirical modes prevalent in twentieth-century science fiction and film, and especially to the dark humor made emblematic by Stanley Kubrick’s film Dr. Strangelove, the article decrypts how Atwood’s MaddAddam and McEwan’s Solar offer incongruously funny representations of ecocatastrophe that—like Kubrick’s famed nuclear-age spoof—serve both to distract from and snap us out of the paralysis of fear, encouraging a self-reflexive mode of reading. In Solar, absurd and slapstick humor marks the rise of an egotistical, Nobel Prize-winning scientist who steals a colleague’s work to develop a technology capable of averting catastrophic warming. In the end, this invites a pragmatic question framed in a light-hearted manner: who cares how the climate crisis is solved, and whether efforts are intellectually honest or affectively in earnest, as long as solutions are found? Meanwhile, Atwood’s novel proves more traditional in its turn to familiar sci-fi conventions of technological satire and dark humor to imagine a post-human future following mutually intertwined eco and techno-catastrophes. In her work, critiques of biotechnology, late-market capitalism, and its irreversible ecological consequences are framed in bitingly comic terms; but this does not prevent the trilogy from retaining a sense of hope and ethical urgency.

AU  - Tyler, Lisa
T2  - The Hemingway Review
AB  - Examined in the light of Timothy Morton's 'dark ecology,' Ernest Hemingway's 1935 work of creative nonfiction, +Green Hills of Africa=, links the desertification of the American Plains states in the American Dust Bowl to the desertification of Africa, attributing both to the depredations of modernity as constructed by white men of European ancestry. Hemingway conflates the narrative's predominant trope of consumption via overzealous hunting to climate change elsewhere in his fiction. He foresees that industrial modernization will inevitably result in ecocatastrophe and in this ecological lament uses memory and nostalgia to memorialize through art what has been lost to environmental damage.

AU  - Scott, Heidi C. M.
T2  - Victorian Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Social, Political, and Cultural Studies
AB  - Climate change toward a tropical England occurs repeatedly in Victorian fiction, and warm weather often carries negative moral valences that show the complexity of Victorian engagement with what we now call the Anthropocene. After discussing the moral implications of several Victorian climate fictions, this essay reads John Ruskin’s The Storm-Cloud of the Nineteenth Century (1884) as a unique work of nonfiction that develops climate science in nascent forms, but transcends its limits using a religious diction that inveighs against individualism and social blasphemy. Ruskin blends observation with revelation to sketch a solution to the 1880s climate calamity by prescribing empathic human behavior. While most environmentalists decry a Good Anthropocene based solely on new technologies, Ruskin and his admirer William Morris root for an alternative happy future by appealing to social cohesion.

TI  - Modelling Realism: Digital Media, Climate Simulations and Climate Fictions
AU  - Konior, Bogna
T2  - Paradoxa: Studies in World Literary Genres
AB  - What is climate fiction? Humanities quarrel over the nature of this newly christened genre, pointing to its activist dimensions and pondering its relationship to realism. In this article, I discuss how digital media studies should enter this debate by analyzing climate simulations as a type of climate fiction, one that lies at the core of any subsequent narrative retellings. The status of climate change itself as a simulation signals that by relegating "climate fiction" to a genre, we miss the opportunity to address the larger net of our climate episteme, where fiction operates on multiple levels. I draw parallels between simulated social scenarios in cli fi and simulated scientific scenarios in climate models, and discuss how climate models are like petri dishes for growing fictional Earths in. Rather than cli fi being a "retelling" of what is knowable through "climate data," I describe how digital climate simulations rely on creating artificial Earths that are worlds unto themselves. It is both through cultural and scientific climate fictions that we model future scenarios. This modelling, a type of "fiction" is in fact the dominant mode of realism with regards to climate change.

AU  - Smith, Philip
T2  - Inks: The Journal of the Comics Studies Society
AB  - In this essay I read Richard McGuire's graphic novel Here as a narratively unorthodox and sophisticated intervention in climate change debate. I seek to show that, by positioning individual narratives in proximity to one another, McGuire dramatizes the tension between historical and culturally embedded narrative frames, demonstrates the mutability of landscape over time, and offers a dramatic visualization of the impact of rising sea levels. In doing so, he demonstrates the limited world-view of the twentieth and twenty-first century subject and the ephemerality of what may seem to be, at the pace of our perception, immutable aspects of our environment. Here, I argue, is a work which might be classified under the broad genre of 'cli-fi'—science fiction which addresses the actuality of climate change, and its narrative structure is central to McGuire's engagement with this subject.

T2  - Paradoxa: Studies in World Literary Genres
AB  - Drawing from a recent AustLit project on climate change fiction, this paper discusses the earliest example we have traced of climate-change fiction in post-invasion Australia: James Edmond's short story "The Fool and His Inheritance." Published in 1911, the story begins in "the basement of things among the coals and the debris" and moves through the Industrial Revolution, water wars, and the Great Slaying to the ultimate destruction of the Last Man by rising oceans. Analysis of this work in the twin contexts of its writing (1911) and our reading (2019) show the seeds of modern climate-change fiction sown over a century ago, as well as revealing the complex roots of such strains of thinking as ecofascism. We bring to this analysis three discrete and distinct approaches: bibliography, environmental science, and feminist cultural studies. From our diverse disciplinary positions, we offer a tripartite analysis to critique Edmond's story, make sense of its place in the "climate change fiction" genre, trouble the genre's origins, and explore the value of multi-disciplinary co-reading approaches to literature.

AU  - Sullivan, Gordon
T2  - Paradoxa: Studies in World Literary Genres
AB  - Weird fiction, especially in its use of cosmic horror, seems like a natural place to find what Timothy Morton has dubbed "hyperobjects," those objects which are so massive in scale that they trouble human intervention or understanding. Morton acknowledges this affinity with reference to H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu, but despite this affinity, cosmic horror has been less willing to tackle one of Morton's canonical hyperobjects--climate change--in part because cosmic horror has generally only worked at the scale of either the human or the cosmic, producing horror from the gap between them. The result is often a pessimistic nihilism, with humans unable to influence the cosmic. In this article, I argue that John Langan's novel of cosmic horror, The Fisherman, offers a way to think cosmic entities as hyperobjects that resist the pessimistic nihilism of much weird fiction. By embedding a cosmic horror tale within a cosmic horror tale and using changes to the weather to bridge the two stories, Langan's novel offers a way to think about human action at different scales that challenges the absolute gap between human and cosmic.

AU  - Gibson, Julia D.
T2  - Paradoxa: Studies in World Literary Genres
AB  - It is perhaps more important than ever for environmental practitioners to grasp that the narratives we/they employ need to accurately describe the political realities of, imagine innovative solutions to, and sustain the most vulnerable through the disaster/injustice that is global climate change. Thus, it is vital for those of us who deal closely with environmental and climate narratives to be able to articulate which texts succeed in these regards both for ourselves and in ways that translate to broader contexts and audiences. In this paper I argue that the visionary (re)descriptive powers so abundant within (post)apocalyptic Indigenous, Afrofuturist, and/or feminist climate fiction are among the right kinds of stories for this work. In addition to considering these narratives' relationships to the practice of climate justice, the paper reflects on the ethical challenges of working with narratives, practices, and practitioners from beyond one's immediate expertise and/or communities.

Boyle’s fictional engagement with the real-world events surrounding the creation of Biosphere 2, is fixated with the question of containment on spatial, intellectual, ecological, and textual levels. This article argues that The Terranauts uses the spectacular figure containment, Biosphere 2, as an apparatus to reveal the non-material components of ecological systems, more specifically the elements of visual symbolic exchange. These exchanges are imbricated in a reflexive and ironic visual ecology that helps to capture and corrects a voyeuristic reading practice destructive to imagining global environmental problems. It also asserts that comic and satiric forms of fictional containment of climate change hold value in their ability to resist simulative forms of eco-politics.

AU  - Christman Lavin, Sophie

AB  - Ecocinema involves the human gaze looking at cinema through the lens of the environment, in a manner analogous to the way feminists provided the cinematic lens of gender in the 1970s. However, as with feminism, enormous differences pertain in regard to how the ecocinema lens is mobilized. In analyzing films from the late 1800s to the early 21st century, ecocinema studies has evolved to include critical lines of inquiry from perspectives of psychology, feminism, socioeconomics, science, and activism. Research frames used in these inquiries include: setting and landscape in films, ecological analyses of mainstream and independent fictional films, posthuman cinematic representations, transnational and regional, and more recently, trauma in speculative dystopian films. Ecocinema critics analyze films of various types, including Hollywood, independent, transnational, documentary, animated, art cinema, and especially climate fiction (“cli-fi”) films. Ramachandra Guha’s transnational typology of environmental ideologies will provide a useful starting place for the mapping of different perspectives in ecocinema. Guha distinguished utopian wilderness environmentalism, pervasive in the United States, from the agrarian focus typical in India. Meanwhile, most developed nations utilize scientific industrial methods to exploit the environment. Oftentimes, these latter approaches are grounded in growth economies and are thus in conflict with the unrealistic ideals of so-called neo-primitivism (NP). Neoprimitivism involves returning to simple, sustainable lifestyles within or close to the natural world—lifestyles that do no environmental damage. NP is beloved by many, but the consensus is that it is idealistic to consider going back to this way of life. A film such as Avatar (produced and directed by James Cameron in 2009) addresses the complexity of diverse constructions of nature by providing examples of utopian wilderness ideology that compete with, and are opposed to, the destructive scientific industrialism that disregards and dominates nature without compunction. Other films, such as Amazon Sisters (Sweeny, 1992), Elemental (Koch, Roshan, & Vaughan-Lee, 2012), Into the Wild (Blocker, Hildebrand, Kelly, & Penn, 2007), or Grizzly Man (Beggs & Herzog, 2005), act as simultaneous celebrations and critiques of wilderness ideologies and deal with gender and racial identities, and thus they have been a central focus of ecocinema scholarship.

Ann Kaplan Subject: Communication and Social Change, Communication and Culture, Media and Communication Policy Online Publication Date: Aug 2017 DOI: 10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.013.121 Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Communication The Climate of Ecocinema Page 2 of 36 PRINTED FROM the OXFORD RESEARCH ENCYCLOPEDIA, COMMUNICATION (communication.oxfordre.com).

Please see applicable Privacy Policy and Legal Notice (for details see Privacy Policy). date: 29 August 2017 Although films from all genres have historically engaged environmental issues, it was rarely in a way that made a self-conscious or critical statement about the human impact on the natural world from the perspective of ecological concerns—this is the focus of ecocinema. See for example, Birt Acres’s Rough Sea at Dover (1895), the Lumiere Brothers’ Oil Wells of Baku (1896), Thomas Edison’s Sorting Refuse at Incinerating Plant, NYC (1903), and the British South Africa Company’s Rhodesia To-Day (1912). In the early 21st century, the genre that most often engages with the contemporary politics of climate change is the documentary. Documentaries, such as An Inconvenient Truth (Guggenheim, 2006), Manufactured Landscapes (Baichwal, 2006), Into Eternity (Eskilsson & Madsen, 2010), Chasing Ice (Ahrens & Orlowski, 2012), E-Waste Tragedy (Esteve, Popp, Úbeda, & Dannoritzer, 2014), This Changes Everything (Cuarón & Lewis, 2015), among others, critique human damage to the planet and thus position viewers as ethical witnesses. Such works hope to influence the outcome of our shared anthropocentric future. The analyses of ecocinema are addressed using two distinct methods—the macro and the micro. The macro method studies how films represent the large-scale processes of earth-based climate systems, and its lens evaluates how films represent climate and environmental dilemmas facing humans as a species. The micro-lens provides enhanced analyses that explore how gender, race, and class figure into the cultural work climate fantasies perform. This lens indexes the ways in which various cultures are often disproportionately impacted by climate systems.1 Oftentimes the macro and micro levels are both incorporated in a single film and reveal the intersection between climate and culture, as seen in Taklub (Trap, Castillo & Mendoza, 2015), a film that portrays Super-typhoon Haiyan and its impact on residents in Tacloban, Philippines. As background to mapping the texts, evolving science discourses will be emphasized as evidence for global warming but with the understanding that this evidence relies on modeling. Although our main concern with this cultural work in ecocinema is how climate change impacts across gender, race, and class, the inequalities revealed also speak to the politics of climate change evident in cinematic treatments of the issue.

TI  - The Four Tourists of the Apocalypse: Figures of the Anthropocene in Caribbean Climate Fiction
AU  - Boswell, Suzanne F.
T2  - Paradoxa: Studies in World Literary Genres
AB  - Scholars of climate fiction often argue that climate change creates narrative innovation: an apocalypse, a generic shift (away from realism), or a historiographical transition (to the Anthropocene). This article looks at Caribbean climate fiction in order to highlight literary responses to the Anthropocene that revolve around stasis and stagnation rather than innovation. In Yoss's A Planet for Rent, tourist authorities preserve the environment in a nostalgic past that avoids ecological catastrophe: a utopia for visitors, and a space of permanent apocalypse for locals. Nalo Hopkinson's "Inselberg" uses the figure of the zombie to break down the barrier between tourist and local, unpacking the colonial violence of preservation for all to see. Caribbean climate fiction focuses on figures of apocalyptic stagnation--the tourist and the zombie--because Caribbean literature responds to a radically different Anthropocene than Western climate fiction, one in which the overarching result of the Anthropocene is environmental stasis, not metamorphosis, and one in which catastrophe comes not from environmental change, but from environmental preservation. This article ultimately makes a case for seeking formal narrative responses to the Anthropocene beyond obvious generic innovation, arguing that postcolonial responses to climate change may instead be found in stagnation, ennui and violent repetition.

TI  - The Hot War: Climate, Security, Fiction
AU  - De Bruyn, Ben
T2  - Studies in the Novel
AB  - This paper examines a set of recent novels in which the problem of climate change is explicitly linked to global war and the security state. The next theater of war after or alongside the war on terror, they suggest, may well be an environment grown unpredictable because of human intervention. Drawing on Robert Marzec’s work on “environmentality,” it describes how novels like Tobias Buckell’s Arctic Rising (2012), Mark de Silva’s Square Wave (2016), and Mohsin Hamid’s How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia (2013) represent the future, past, and present of a world shaped by an “ecosecurity imaginary.” Additionally, the analysis links these narratives to scenario planning, nuclear dread, and slow violence to suggest, first, that we should expand a limited category like ‘cli-fi’ to include less obvious examples and, second, that we should consider fiction’s complicity with as well as critique of this militarized environmentalism. What is more, the analysis reveals the strong ties between this new, “hot war” and the Cold War, and identifies a shared suspicion of geo-engineering projects among contemporary writers.

TI  - The Legend of Zelda in the Anthropocene
AU  - Canavan, Gerry
T2  - Paradoxa: Studies in World Literary Genres
AB  - The Legend of Zelda (1986), for the original Nintendo Entertainment System, posited an immediately familiar fantasy milieu: a sleeping princess, an evil king, magical helpers, ancient artifacts of intense power, the rise of a hero. Players guide that hero, Link, through a series of increasingly difficult dungeons, accumulating tools and expanding their abilities in a linear narrative of personal development until they are finally able to defeat Ganon, rescue Zelda, and save the beleaguered kingdom of Hyrule. The end. But subsequent entries in the series cannot adhere to this narrative of linear progress and individual triumph, developing instead an increasingly convoluted meta-narrative in which Hyrule is beset by a recurring, multi-generational curse that cannot ever be expiated or broken, only (at best) temporarily delayed. As with other long-running SF/F franchises (Star Wars, StarTrek, Harry Potter, D.C. and Marvel comics, and others), therefore, entries in the Zelda series since the original take place in an increasingly tragic universe, in which the reincarnations of the original Link and Zelda are reborn over and over again to defeat an unkillable Ganon. This entropic logic reaches its greatest expression in the transcendent Breath of the Wild (2017) for the Nintendo Switch, an immense open-world game that takes place in a ruined Hyrule which Link and Zelda had failed to save. Suspending Link in a techno-organic cocoon that puts him to sleep for a thousand years--itself the remnant of an advanced ancient civilization that had fallen into ruin millennia before their time--Zelda magically freezes herself and Ganon in time just moments before Ganon's victory in order to prevent his final ascension, and thus allowing Link sufficient time to recuperate and gain the new powers necessary to win this time. The game's breathtaking vistas and acclaimed sandbox gameplay are thus part and parcel of its dyspeptic vision of the Anthropocene-- Wild's Hyrule is a depopulated and (multiply) destroyed civilization, whose always-already ruined future can only be mitigated against, not prevented or saved.

TI  - The Novel after Nature, Nature after the Novel: Richard Jefferies’s Anthropocene Romance
AU  - Taylor, Jesse Oak
T2  - Studies in the Novel
AB  - The history of the novel must be re-thought in light of the emergence of the Anthropocene. The period associated with the “rise of the novel” in the eighteenth and nineteenth century dovetails with the emergence of industrial capitalism, the shift to fossil fuels, and European imperialism, all of which are now recognized as key elements in the scaling-up of human activity to planetary scale. It also aligns with the emergence of modern geology and the stratigraphic method currently being used to date the Anthropocene as a formal epoch on the geologic time scale (GTS). Thus, if the Anthropocene presents the work of the novel “after nature” it also represents the state of nature “after” the novel. This convergence suggests that the rise of the novel may also mark the birth of the Anthropocene. It also raises troubling questions about whether such coincidence may in fact reveal complicity. To what degree is the novel itself bound up in the forces responsible for drawing the Holocene to a close? What does it mean to re-visit the history of the novel as an “end-Holocene” genre, and what would that designation suggest about the genre’s viability in the epoch to come? This article takes up these questions through a reading of Richard Jefferies’s After London, or Wild England (1885) as a formative instance of “cli fi” that explicitly disavows the designation of “novel” in favor of “romance.” In the process, it argues for a more historically expansive conception of cli fi, and points to potential intersections between ecocriticism, textual studies, and book history.

TI  - The Rest Is Silence: Postmodern and Postcolonial Possibilities in Climate Change Fiction

T2  - Studies in the Novel
AB  - In this essay, I consider postmodernist tendencies in two recent climate change novels, Alexis Wright’s The Swan Book (2013) and Chang-rae Lee’s On Such a Full Sea (2014). While I hesitate to claim that these herald a distinct postmodern turn in climate change fiction, I argue that these novels’ postmodernist self-awareness constitutes a promising new direction for fiction in the Anthropocene. Displaying a postcolonial awareness and deploying the postmodernist strategies of metafiction and magical realism, the novels undermine the omniscience of third-person narrators and the reliability of focalizers in order simultaneously to destabilize realist, imperialist, and anthropocentric constructions of the world. Indeed, they not only question the dominance of master-narratives; they question domination per se. That is, in these novels, voice itself comes under suspicion as an anthropocentric fallacy.

TI  - Unequal Survival: Climate Fiction, Paranoid Anthropocentrism, and the Politics of Existential Risk
AU  - Harper, Tyler Austin
T2  - Paradoxa: Studies in World Literary Genres
AB  - In this article I examine the rhetorics that have informed literary and filmic works in which climate change is depicted as an "existential risk," that is, as a threat to the survival of the human species. More specifically, I will suggest that literary and filmic reflection on human extinction in general, and human extinction via climate change in particular, is frequently marked by a disposition referred to here as "paranoid anthropocentrism": an ideology predicated on the notion that the human species is at once the site of a permanent emergency (always-already vulnerable to extinction at the hands of a hostile environment) and is a species with the unique capacity to self-consciously direct its own survival. Undertaking close readings of Alfonso Cuaron's film Children of Men, the British biologist J.B.S. Haldane's short work of theory-fiction "The Last Judgement," and Jeanette Winterson's novel The Stone Gods, I will interrogate the universalist fantasies that frequently subtend representations of climatic existential risk, examining how "the good of the species" is often invoked in order to justify extreme--and tacitly racialized--measures aimed at ensuring human survival.

TI  - Video Games As Interventions in the Climate Disaster
AU  - Kunzelman, Cameron
T2  - Paradoxa: Studies in World Literary Genres
AB  - This essay begins with a deep scepticism that video games can convince or entrain their players into accomplishing concrete goals when it comes to the current environmental catastrophe. It works through the relationship between aesthetics, game mechanics, and politics examining three modes in which video games have engaged questions of the environment. The first is through modeling climate change and its effects, allowing players to interact with that model. The second is through affect, by which this essay means the creation of specific contexts to generate particular forms of feeling and emotion. The third way takes elements from both of these and purposefully puts players in a context in which their digital existence is as wrapped up in climate change as our own lives are in the world outside the game. I call these "direct intervention games," and argue that they are the best mode through which video games can approach climate change if they are to achieve anything of consequence in the political and social realms.

TI  - Welcome to the Post-Anthropolis: Urban Space and Climate Change in Nathaniel Rich's Odds against Tomorrow, Lev Rosen's Depth, and Kim Stanley Robinson's New York 2140
AU  - Mączyńska, Magdalena
T2  - Journal of Modern Literature
AB  - Three recent climate fictions set in New York City—Nathaniel Rich's Odds Against Tomorrow (2013), Lev Rosen's Depth (2015), and Kim Stanley Robinson's New York 2140 (2017)—reimagine urban space in climate crisis. Reflecting contemporary concerns, Rich, Rosen, and Robinson represent Manhattan in novel ways: as an ecosystem and a multi-species habitat. This imaginary city reaches deep into the bedrock and expands into (and beyond) the New York Bight to reveal a vaster, unfamiliar, less human-centered eco-polis. Although the novels depart from anthropocentric traditions of urban representation, their portrayals of the relationship between the city and its environment recall Romantic and colonial tropes (the aesthetization of “nature” as an autonomous realm, the romance of wilderness, the erasure of Native histories). These fictions highlight the challenge of forging new spatial imaginaries for the Anthropocene.
