AB  - [Very broadly speaking, beginning with the development of a social science-fictional mode, a number of postwar authors began exploring how forms of exceptionally accurate foresight might effect the development of a society. The social effects of the mobilization of extraordinary forms of prognostication were explored by numerous authors in the 1940s and 1950s, including Alfred Bester, Philip K. Dick, A.E. van Vogt, and Isaac Asimov. This became a significant, but theoretically and critically understudied, motif in sf during the 1960s and 1970s. Relative to the study of prognostication in history, this body of sf literature provides a unique perspective on the relationship between predictive methods and governance, offering a corpus of theoretical reflections on how the implementation of hypothetical, infallible (or nearly infallible) prognostic systems could affect different types of social order. In this essay, I will briefly explore the development of prognostication and precognition as socially- embedded novums and investigate what these sources tell us about prognostication in history when viewed through the lens of Western metaphysics and the Western literary imagination. In doing so, I propose a binary taxonomy as a heuristic, organizing texts with prognostication or precognition as their central novum into two general modes: (1) positivist/techno-optimist and (2) romantic/techno-pessimist. The intellectual history of these tendencies in the literature is explored and compared through several exemplary texts.]

AB  - [In many respects, 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and His Master’s Voice (1968) could not be more different. Kubrick/Clarke’s mystical and affirmational visions of space exploration and humankind’s technological evolution are decisively countered by Lem’s downbeat tale about failed communication with the aliens. Rather than conventional first-contact stories, these texts are more specifically about the impact of messages received from outer space, which sf fans either reading or going to the movie theatres were surely encouraged to evaluate within the context of “space-age” technology and lifestyle. What did it mean to be space-faring humans, leaving the Earth behind? What were the political and social consequences of technocracy and the space race? How was “big science” changing politics and society, both in the East and West? How was it changing the ways that humans might take the measure of themselves? These are big questions, and I have chosen the Kubrick/Clarke and Lem works, created on either side of the Iron Curtain, because I believe that their juxtaposition helps us to appreciate the central role of the Cold War struggle in shaping the sf genre’s responsiveness to the times.]

AB  - [This article reexamines and reframes Philip K. Dick’s sprawling philosophical text, known as the Exegesis, in relation to his widely celebrated fiction, philosophies of mysticism, posthumanism, and transhumanism, and more generally, the difficult task of discovering means of transforming our personal and cultural values to be more adequately attuned to our changing environment. I consider how the ontological uncertainty produced in sf relates to an inevitable ontological disorientation produced by science and technology, and show how this leads to a particular (and particularly mystical, for reasons explained) task: the need to estrange ourselves from our traditional human concepts, values, beliefs, and cultures. Using passages from the Exegesis, I lay out how Dick sets up the task of the Exegesis as a kind of simulation of moksha (liberation, in a profound sense), reading the Exegesis as the venue for Dick to run philosophical and personal counterparts to the simulations of his fiction. Dick’s remixing of mystical and transhuman rhetoric also clarifies mysticism’s relationship to science fiction. Along the way, I reread Martian Time-Slip, Ubik, Valis, and The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch through the frame and task set up in the Exegesis, resulting in a new reading of Dick’s work that integrates with his post-1974 experiences and writing.]

AB  - [H.G. Wells is sometimes credited with a stylistic rupture that separated science fiction from other fantastic genres, eschewing magical elements in favor of empiricist and rationalist knowledge. While there is merit to this narrative, this article argues for a more complex genre heritage by evaluating the fiction of Edward Bulwer-Lytton as an indicative example of a competing nineteenth-century strand of occult science fiction. This form, quite popular in the period, drew on methods of scientific legitimation used by esoteric traditions such as Theosophy and Spiritualism, as well as theories of the mind such as clairvoyance and telepathy, producing fiction that was in dialogue with scientific currents of the day but that did not reject magic. Indeed, noting that Wells consciously exploited the narrative value of esoteric science in a number of his early short stories, the article argues that the fiction of authors such as Bulwer-Lytton is distinguished from the form championed by Wells not by an exorcism of magic but by a productive occlusion of it. The article concludes by outlining the methods and continuing influence of this occlusion, arguing that esoteric sciences have continued to influence and generate the tropes, novums, and stylistics of science fiction.]

AB  - [This essay explores the connection between R.L. Stevenson and H.G. Wells, with a particular focus on their shared interest in the ethical implications of expansionism at the close of the nineteenth century. In The Island of Doctor Moreau, Wells surprisingly appears to have extensively borrowed from and reworked Stevenson’s Pacific tale The Ebb-Tide. On these grounds, it is possible to trace an implied conversation between Wells and Stevenson, which takes its cue from Robert M. Philmus’s pioneering works on the “Strange Case of Moreau.” Moreau, as Philmus and other critics have noted, is in fact rich with intertextual connections, which complicate its meaning and make it highly ambivalent. The Ebb-Tide, a major and leading source text seemingly as relevant as Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, has been largely neglected by contemporary criticism. Bringing more evidence to the case, this essay also connects Wells and Stevenson to a shared ideological awareness, while shedding more light on the sociopolitical horizons of Wells’s early sf.]

AB  - [This essay analyzes certain audio-visual sf narratives that are primarily distributed via VOD (video-on-demand) platforms, specifically focusing on episodes of Netflix’s Black Mirror and Amazon’s Electric Dreams, considering both in the context of post- cinematic spectatorship. It shows how the ostensibly subversive, anti-capitalist narratives of these shows may lead towards conformity with hegemonic individualism, especially when viewed through VOD platforms. The underlying assumption is that the possibility of subversion is dialectically entwined with—yet not necessarily annulled by—its recuperation by dominant neoliberal individualism, which makes each of these series ambiguously open-ended in their ideological effects. Although this essay centers upon two examples within their specific context of reception, it also suggests a larger theoretical framework for the understanding of similar forms of contemporary sf, proposing “melodramatic science fiction” as an analytic lens that incorporates and reframes ideas originally developed for the criticism of melodrama.]

AB  - [This paper explores how George Turner's The Sea and Summer utilizes nostalgic narrative to develop an affective attachment to the climate disaster and instigates, in its narrative, meaningful change. Through a consideration of Svetlana Boym's reflective nostalgia, the affective response the novel activates, and the affect created by Gothic tropes, I suggest that this combination produces an exemplary response. The narrative presents a frame story set in a distant future after the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet, and the bulk of the prescient climate sf novel is presented as a novelistic rendering of this pre-apocalyptic scenario. This combination allows the reader to consider the temporal scale, producing a medium scale, which allows the reader to grasp the complexity of the problem without being overwhelmed by its vastness. I argue that rather than exorcising our fears, such literary narratives can make the realities of climate change more present to contemporary readers.]

AB  - [Neither science fiction nor what Svetlana Boym calls “reflective nostalgia” claim to relate to the actual past or future. Rather, they are both concerned with the unrealized, the unpredictable, and the unarticulated. Jack Womack's Elvissey (1993) explores nostalgia through a range of its reverberations in both the public and private spheres. Elvissey gives expression to the creative and speculative dimensions of both sf and nostalgia to act as a diagnostic for the complexities and challenges of history and identity. With race as a central focus, Womack's novel employs the figure of Elvis Presley as a metaphor for the enduring power of a mythical 1950s to serve as the ground zero of white nostalgia. This article explores Womack's novel using Boym's framework of “restorative” and “reflective” nostalgia to demonstrate how sf, as a mechanism for understanding the present and guiding future actions, can provide privileged access to pastness and futurity. Most importantly, Elvissey explores how sf can render visible the affective forces that underpin nostalgic longing while also providing access to the mythical past.]

AB  - [This article examines the uses of nostalgia in Kazuo Ishiguro's dystopian novel Never Let Me Go. Set against a backdrop of pastoral England in the late 1990s, this fictional memoir of a clone named Kathy H. provides a poignant account of clones who are fated for compulsory organ donation and premature death. While Never Let Me Go can be seen as a nostalgia-inducing, feel-good commodity, its main function is to present a philosophy of reclaiming and repurposing what has been given through remembrance. The article also focuses on subjects who fail to use nostalgia as a therapeutic tool to counter despair, with special attention to an original character added in the Japanese television adaptation. To further augment this point, the article explores the possibility of queer nostalgia in Kathy's recollection of Miss Emily, Madame, and Ruth. This in-depth analysis of (queer) failed subjects tackles the question of how memories with rather negative valence, when remembered with endearment can operate as an acknowledgment of the act of wishing otherwise. The importance of Never Let Me Go as an affective cartography of hope is paramount in that it points to somewhere between despair and submission.]

AB  - [Originally conceived as an adaptation of the works of Jules Verne by Hayao Miyazaki and eventually developed by Hideaki Anno and the studio Gainax, Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water (1990-1991) acts as one of the clearest examples of the fascinating interdependencies that are evident between the Japanese entertainment industries and the movement that has become known as steampunk. Variously defined as neovictorientalism and steampanku by those with an interest in its representations of industrial nostalgia, Japanese steampunk has served as a rich resource for representations of Japan's past, present, and future, filtered through the iconography of fantastical steam-powered and piston-driven machinery. This article offers a close analysis of the series and considers the ways that its reworking of archetypal representations of nineteenth-century sf offer opportunities to evaluate the enormously complex and contradictory facets of nostalgic reminiscence. By considering the ways that the series fetishizes referents to this past age of technological development, I evaluate the means through which a legacy of bygone scientific romance and imperial adventure continues to reflect the fin-de-siècle concerns of a later century and Japan's own orientation in a globalized and postcolonial world.]

AB  - [In this article, we turn our gaze to the television series The Handmaid's Tale to examine different critical aspects of nostalgia in relation to contemporary and previous feminist debates. Our purpose is to analyze not only the series' different approaches to nostalgia but also to question the type of feminism the female dystopia attempts to recuperate. We enquire into the political capacity of the show's nostalgia to advance the complex debate on the subject of feminism. In our opinion, the series articulates a conservative recuperation of old feminist debates centered on the female subject (motherhood, rape, pornography, prostitution, etc.) not only due to the threat of the recent misogynistic backlash but also in response to the growth of political power from the LGBTQI movement and the subsequent displacement of traditional feminist issues. Nevertheless, despite falling short of contributing to an intersectional and structural critique of gender injustices, the show constitutes a stimulating catalyst in the fight and debate regarding the improvement of women's lives against the advances of retrograde attitudes and policies in current times. Ultimately, the series defies any monolithic understanding of nostalgia as either amnesiac and regressive or as reflective, inspiring, and recuperative regarding gender.]

AB  - [This article argues that Ling Ma's 2018 novel Severance positions American consumerism and its ties to East Asian economies and mass production as the origin point for an apocalyptic future. Severance's nostalgic attachments to both the 1980s and to China serve as a roadmap for understanding currently unfolding global crises, rendering visible the west's complicated and longstanding imbrication with East Asian economies and labor practices that are frequently downplayed, if remarked upon at all, in western mass-media framings. Beginning by offering “imperialist nostalgia” as a framework through which to approach the double-bind of nostalgic attachment and affect in Ma's text, I argue that it is the protagonist's positionality as a transpacific subject—i.e, as a diasporic Chinese American with economic and personal ties to both her country of origin and her country of residence—that enables the reader to make sense of nostalgia's capacity to injure and conceal harm. I then move to consider the text's nostalgic inheritances from the 1980s, both in the form of film genres that inform its speculative structure and in the specters of economic excess that haunt the novel. Here, I position Severance within a long line of American sf that takes capitalist excess and/or a fear of East Asian economic ascendence as its animating principle, while also underscoring the novel's unique intervention in this genre through its engagement with forms of imperialist nostalgia.]

AB  - [This paper traces how space travel, as a dream of the past, is imaged and imagined in the work of Palestinian artist Larissa Sansour and Lebanese artist and filmmakers Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige. I offer close readings of individual artworks and analyze how conceptions of national belonging, individual and collective aspiration, and complex rapports with temporality are fractured, rethought, and grappled with. Drawing on Svetlana Boym's compelling conceptualization of nostalgia, I analyze notions of national belonging, individual and collective aspiration, and complex temporality as constitutive features of these artworks. Sansour uses sf tropes to articulate the Palestinian plight in A Space Exodus (2009), referencing Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Neil Armstrong's iconic moon landing, to claim the moon as Palestinian territory. Sansour's retrofuturist invocation of what Paweł Frelik has called a “future past,” is a site of both possibility and commemoration, in which notions of colonialism, home, and national trauma are echoed as much as they are troubled. In their documentary The Lebanese Rocket Society (2012), Lebanese artists Hadjithomas and Joreige are torn between nostalgia for the modern utopia promised by the 1960's Nasserist Pan-Arab dream and the struggle to represent an actual imaginary for the future. I suggest that in both films longing for what lies beyond the stars is not necessarily found in the future, but is sometimes found in the nostalgia of a future past.]

AB  - [This article argues for a reconceptualization of the role of nostalgia in Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower to reconsider notions of shelter, dislocation, memory, home, and loss. More specifically, it aims to disentangle the complex interrelation between post-nostalgia, space, inherited memory, and speculation to identify sites of memory where a sense of home can be (re)drawn after apocalypse. In the novel, Butler discerns a post-apocalyptic world in which the downfall of previous political regimes has dissolved the senses of place, identity and community. Through speculation, Butler resituates the home(land) as a distant geographical and temporal construction that is both remote and damaged and can be retrieved only via post-memory, adaptability, and change. By examining the characters' relation with and resignification of the different spaces they occupy, this article reimagines the site of memory from the theoretical prism of post-nostalgia to locate emotional traces that elicit figurative journeys or returns home. If speculative fiction can dissect the world after catastrophe and help identify possible outcomes that project and respond to actual feelings of uncertainty and social unrest, then nostalgia's potential for subversion and change can be catalyzed by means of “speculative memory” to produce post-nostalgic figurations that might help retrieve a sense of community, ethics, and (home)place.]

AB  - [It is the general scholarly consensus that the space enthusiasm that characterized the Khrushchev era, which envisioned high hopes for a technologically advanced near-future where humanity would reap the fruits of realized communism and explore the universe, gradually subsided until disappearing during the subsequent years of economic and social stagnation. A close look at non-fiction literary production aimed at children and teenagers illuminates a different perspective, however. In this article, I analyze the narratives and discourses in several children science books published during the years 1974–1985 in the Soviet Union. Surprisingly, themes connected to the so-called Space Age are omnipresent in these publications. The narratives intertwine and overlap to create a peculiar blend of communist future-oriented ideals and sf motives. In order to explain this tendency, I propose that this phenomenon may be linked to a strong feeling of nostalgia felt by the adult authors toward this recent “future-past” of Khrushchev's times, which was then transposed into their popular science works. Thus, during times characterized by multiple crises, the myth of Space Conquest provided a strong counter-discourse, an escapist utopian vision appropriate to the original communist idea, which the official political discourse itself employed in its propaganda, but obviously devoid of its transformative content. This study sheds a new light on the connection between the sf imagination, popular science, and politics in the late Soviet era.]

AB  - [In the contemporary crisis of race relations two schools of thought pursue the project of Black liberation: Afrofuturism and Afropessimism. Through a close reading of Neill Blomkamp's Afropessimist film District 9 (2009) and Nnedi Okorafor's Afrofuturist novel Lagoon (2014), written in response to the film, this article analyzes these projects' futures. While Afropessimism offers incisive critiques of historic and contemporary racism, the future it imagines is either a repetition of the past or a violent revolution. Afrofuturism, in contrast, imagines a future that breaks from colonially inherited racism by emphasizing traditional and indigenous African cultures. By narrating human being through something other than the framework of an imposed colonialism, Afrofuturism can imagine an end to the alienation District 9 depicts as largely inevitable. In order for Afrofuturism's future to be realized in white majority or white dominated societies (such as South Africa), however, the burden of eliminating these racist conceptions falls on white people. Afrofuturism can provide this much needed alternative model of African diasporic humanity and therefore serve as a conceptual foundation for a future that does not look like the past.]

AB  - [An intriguing commonality among Nietzschean readings of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is the scant attention they pay to the representation of aliens, one of the film's most thought-provoking sf elements. If one moves beyond allegorical readings and takes the film's storyline about extraterrestrial entities guiding human evolution literally, it is apparent how 2001 mounts a challenge to Nietzsche's staunchly human-oriented, terrestrial philosophy. An important basis for this challenge is the Christian-influenced branch of sf defined by Arthur C. Clarke, Olaf Stapledon, and even John Milton, which the film reflects in both its plot and sublime aesthetics. The film's musical evocations of extraterrestrials prompt us to contemplate otherworldly possibilities that Nietzsche dismisses, but Kubrick's extensive effort and failure to create a viable visual representation of the aliens creates a lacuna that makes the final part of 2001 profoundly ambiguous and agnostic.]

AB  - [This paper develops a framework for reading fictional languages and neologisms in science fiction that complements prior critical approaches focused on linguistics or quantification. It argues that interpreting the inclusion of alien languages as a form of multilingual writing (albeit one where the source language does not exist) is a productive mode of analyzing science fiction. Bakhtin's thought on heteroglossia as well as contemporary approaches to multilingual writing are employed to coin and refine the concept of fictive multilingualism. The mode of analysis is exemplified by applying it to Ursula K. Le Guin's use of created languages, particularly in Always Coming Home (1985) and The Dispossessed (1974), in which fictive multilingualism serves both to construct plausible alien worlds and call attention to their textually constructed nature. The narratives of decipherment in Always Coming Home, manifested through untranslated or polyphonic terms, are explored in depth to support this point. In contrast to existing cultural criticism about created languages in sf, which tends towards analysis of neologisms in isolation, my approach is based on detailed readings of neologisms and other expressions of created languages as they function within a text and in relation to its main language.]

AB  - [The literature of cosmic exploration has long had a close relationship with telepathy: in such fiction, apparent new discoveries in the human mind often accompany new discoveries in the cosmos. This article suggests that Olaf Stapledon is a key progenitor of this association. His Last and First Men, Last Men in London, and Star Maker each cover billions of years of human development, and each spans vast expanses of space. In these novels, telepathy allows characters to connect across great temporal and spatial distances. This article argues, however, that telepathy for Stapledon is not simply a thematic parallel to external discoveries. Instead, telepathy is central to his understanding of human potential. Inspired by advocates of telepathy, including J.B. Rhine and J.W. Dunne, Stapledon sees mind-to-mind connection as the natural consummation of a drive toward an ever-greater group feeling—a drive he finds truly universal. Following Stapledon, writers such as Stanisław Lem and Doris Lessing continue to explore what it means to imagine contact on a cosmic scale but suggest that the unintended projection of the human onto the alien is more likely than true connection.]

AB  - [This paper employs theories of childhood sexuality to frame an analysis of the posthuman politics in Octavia E. Butler's vampire novel Fledgling (2005). Throughout the novel, Shori, the child protagonist, discovers her posthuman identity through political and social discourses of her juvenile sexuality. Designed as a genetic experiment to breed sun-resistant melanin into the population of her vampire species, Shori's procreative potential forms one of the central conflicts of the novel. Childhood sexuality also serves a didactic role, helping both human and vampire characters create, accept, and learn about posthuman ways of being. I draw on Rosi Braidotti's conception of an embodied critical posthumanism and bring it into conversations with scholars of childhood sexuality—including Katheryn Bond Stockton, James Kincaid, Steven Bruhm, and Natasha Hurley—to interrogate the posthuman potential of the sexual child. It follows that I examine how Shori's juvenile sexuality marks a continuation of Butler's longstanding interests in discourses of race, agency, and symbiosis. The complexity of childhood sexuality in the novel challenges popular narratives of childhood innocence and establishes the child as a productive site of posthuman possibility.]

AB  - [Ted Chiang's The Lifecycle of Software Objects shows how life and the lifecycles of human and nonhuman artificial life are dictated by technological determinism and market primacy. Such social forces, however, are not absolute, as Chiang explores the ways in which his characters can make choices that do not always follow the principles of utility and economy. For Chiang, such possibilities emerge from everyday life—a site that enables the gradual accretion of knowledge and experience, fostering intelligence and friendship that favor the humanist values of development, codependency, and solidarity. The characters learn to cooperate and commit themselves to each other, defying the deterministic narrative that binds nonhuman life to a short-lived, programmed lifecycle, on the one hand, and subjects human life to the future of super-artificial intelligence on the other. In times when everyday life appears to be under the impervious rule of the market and technology, Chiang's story reflects on the porosity through which more viable transspecies social relations and visions can arise.]

AB  - [Victor Frankenstein fails in his profession because he consistently contravenes three basic tenets of scientific community: observation, repetition, and transparency. Critics of Frankenstein have generally failed to recognize the socially responsible scientific values that Shelley attempts to define through the character of the creature. This article argues that Shelley's novel puts forward the idea of socially responsible science: cooperative forms of experimentation that reimagine the scientist's materials and instruments as agents, involve multiple points of view, and pursue mutually beneficial discoveries. Shelley depicts the creature's trial-and-error tests as the natural and instinctual antithesis of Victor's unnatural and artificial laboratory work; the creature's empiricism satisfies needs and solves specific human problems. Shelley's farsighted fiction promotes this vision in an age when the scientific revolution had made science truly popular. Her fictional experiments with the idea of socially responsible science enable us to read Frankenstein as a work of science fiction that offers both a utopian ethic of intellectual partnership and a critique of singular science. If Shelley's vision of a more open and reflective scientific community aspired to a potentially impossible ideal, it is one toward which she thought her age should aspire.]

AB  - [This essay reconsiders what genre historian Bradley Schauer terms the “pulp paradox,” that is, the film industry's supposed reluctance to produce sf films because of a fear that doing so would associate the movies with “the less reputable variations of the genre” often associated with pulp literature. It examines this notion by considering a partnership in the 1950s between producer George Pal, major film studio Paramount Pictures, and the most respected of the sf pulps, Astounding Science Fiction. In this period Astounding published a series of articles sponsored by Pal and Paramount designed to help market a group of films: Destination Moon (1950), When Worlds Collide (1951), The War of the Worlds (1953), and Conquest of Space (1955). The articles, however, would reveal a level of irony in this industry strategy, for while they initially sought to stress the scientific and technological accuracy to be found these films, they—in concert with the films themselves and other marketing strategies—would also increasingly suggest a kind of pulpiness in the films. During the course of this decade the film industry, with its emphasis on special effects, what Susan Sontag refers to as an “imagination of disaster,” and a sensationalistic and at times lurid imagery, became the real purveyor of a pulp vision.]

AB  - [This article revisits a well-known discussion about morality in J.G. Ballard's Crash that surrounded the appearance of Jean Baudrillard's essay of the same name in a special section of SFS (Nov. 1991). In this debate, N. Katherine Hayles and Vivian Sobchack strongly oppose Baudrillard's claim that there “is no affectivity behind [the world that Crash depicts]: no psychology, no ambivalence or desire, no libido or death drive” (314) to Ballard's novel, and, accordingly, no moral point or warning either. In contrast, Hayles and Sobchack argue that the novel warns us about the transformative influence of contemporary technology. I undertake a thorough analysis of Crash's main poetic features: the prevalence of showing over telling, the recurrence of accounts over descriptions, the thoroughly technical vocabulary, allusions to transcendence, and the interpretive anxiety created by a first-person narrator that bears the author's name. I map the contrast between Ballard's disinterested style of writing and the apparent affective charge of his characters while showing how this contrast generates a deep ambivalence that enables both moral and morally indifferent interpretations of the novel. The reader is never told what to think about the obscene events that occur and this provokes her to make difficult moral decisions about the novel.]

AB  - [Chinese sf can be characterized by its generic hybridity: how it combines, subverts, and reinterprets conventions of both earlier Chinese literary traditions and the Western sf canon. One example of this generic hybridity is the paradigm of information degradation, a common sf trope from H.G. Wells on that shares epistemological and ontological features with the work of early-twentieth-century Chinese realist writer Lu Xun. This essay uses the information degradation paradigm to present a science-fictional reading of Lu Xun's “Diary of a Madman” (1918), the first work of modern Chinese vernacular fiction and a foundational text in establishing Chinese national literature. Then, the article extrapolates how this reading of “Diary” is relevant to contemporary Chinese sf through close readings of Han Song's “The Passengers and the Creator” (2006) and Zhang Ran's “Ether” (2012). These stories adapt the information degradation paradigm in ways that evoke both Lu Xun and Wells and his followers, maintaining continuity with both traditions and illustrating a generic hybridity characteristic of contemporary Chinese sf that may account in part for its growing popularity.]

AB  - [Modern and contemporary artists working in relation to monumentality have sometimes positioned their works in relation to sf, and at other times works of monumental sculpture have been labeled as science-fictional by audiences to whom these monumental forms appear alien or displaced in time. While art history has sometimes examined the influence of sf ideas on modern and contemporary artists, a more sustained consideration of the relationship between monumentality and sf is lacking. One necessary step in advancing this understanding is a consideration of how monuments themselves have been represented in sf literature. This article examines the representations and roles of monuments in a number of sf works, including H.G. Wells's The Time Machine (1895), H.P. Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness (1936), Robert Charles Wilson's The Chronoliths (2001), and Kim Stanley Robinson's Icehenge (1984). The ways in which monuments appear in these and other sf texts foreground a set of questions about the perception of inevitability, the shape of time, and the mutability of history. These works explore how the relationship between past and future can be reconfigured through encounters with monumental forms that create new bridges and chronologies across cosmic and historical scales of time.]

AB  - [“Screening Prophetic Machines” argues that director Steven Spielberg's film Minority Report (2002) stages inconsistencies in the ideological fantasies of prophetic inevitability and preventive action that sustained the George W. Bush administration's post 9/11 policy of preemption, otherwise known as the Bush Doctrine. It observes that the film hyperbolizes this policy through the science-fictional tropes of the “prophetic machine,” which fuse preemption's speculative logics, traumatic affects, and excessive responses with contemporary media, screens, and surveillance to figure the American War on Terror and its ideological foreclosure of alternative futures. While acknow-ledging these parallels, however, this essay complicates criticism that proposes Minority Report inadequately critiques or even uncritically reproduces Bush-era ideology. Instead, it locates Minority Report's politics in cinematic form, claiming that the film's multiple possible endings suggest an array of possibilities for both narrative and prophetic closure that, when understood to be in tension, subvert assertions of preemptive certainty. Drawing from Fredric Jameson's work on utopian fiction, this essay thus examines how preemptive discourse and cinematic form converse in the film, and ultimately contends that Minority Report, because of its resistance to narrative closure, redirects attention from metaphysical discourses of fate and inevitability to the potential dangers of misplaced trust in interpretive authority.]

AB  - [This article connects the recent flourishing of economic science fiction with the increasing technicity of contemporary financial markets, to pose questions about computational economies, both historical and fictional, and their ambiguous utopian currents. It explores examples of computational economies and societies in which economic resources are largely defined and allocated by computational systems to challenge—if not entirely dispel—assumptions about the inextricability of computation and the dystopian specters of capitalism, authoritarianism, and totalitarianism. The article puts insights from the histories of cybernetics, computer science, and economics into dialogue with sf novels that experiment with different sociopolitical configurations of computational economies. The novels that are the primary focus of the discussion are The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia (1974) by Ursula K. Le Guin and If Then (2015) by Matthew De Abaitua. The article concludes with some thoughts about the use of history and fiction for expanding the imaginative horizons of the computable in economics.]

AB  - [This article reads the two standalone novels by Octavia Butler, Kindred and Fledgling, through the theoretical lens of shame. Through my close readings of the texts, I argue that the affect of shame, as it brings emotional and physical pain to the victims, is also indispensable to the survival of human community. Specifically, I propose three main claims about the representations of shame in Butler: that shame is largely a learned response closely associated with substances such as human blood, that to be shamed is to have always already been shamed, and that a permanent separation from shame poses life-threatening consequences. Of particular importance to my readings are earlier discussions about shame's productive roles, including those formulated in Silvan Tomkins's Affect Imagery Consciousness. Rather than recast shame in a completely positive light, I point to a capaciousness in Butler's understanding of shame.]

AB  - [This article focuses on attempts to control and contain translations from English of science fiction in the People's Republic of Poland (1944/45-1989). After a brief outline of the history of sf in twentieth-century Poland, I consider reasons for the weak representation of some foreign authors (e.g. Robert Heinlein) in post-war Polish sf publishing before turning to comparisons of English originals and their Polish translations in order to detect and discuss instances of censorship. Despite its mass appeal (one sf magazine had print runs of 100,000 a month in the 1980s), sf was not heavily censored. I offer some explanations for the comparative freedom from political interference English-language sf enjoyed in translation. For example, the concern of many writers with grand questions touching the entire human race protected their work from censors more concerned with immediate political exigencies.]

AB  - [In this essay I argue that Tiptree's “The Girl Who Was Plugged In” disputes finance capitalism's considerable hold on the future through temporal and material indeterminacies that affirm the openness of the future. Pointing to speculative fiction's and finance capitalism's shared investment in speculation, this essay demonstrates that Tiptree's story stages the future as a contested site between capitalism and the reader. Specifically, I argue that the story is replete with indeterminacies that insist on both the uncertainty of the future and the possibility of imagining futures that are not cannibalized by capitalism, markets, and financial tools that bank on speculation. In conversation with feminist materialist theory, which highlights materiality's unruliness and uncontrollable capacities, I analyze the story's emphasis on material bodies and corporeality as generating strange, unthinkable possibilities for the future, particularly those that imagine a future not foreclosed by capitalism. Attending to both the prevalence of fleshy bodies as well as the story's time-travel conceit, I read these narrative elements as “tactical paradoxes” that destabilize the boundaries between the thinkable and the unthinkable, the possible and the impossible within a world structured by capitalism.]

AB  - [A growing number of twenty-first century sf novels have taken up the complexities of globalization from a variety of perspectives. While Anglo-American sf has tended to receive a lot of academic attention, texts from other parts of the world that can provide valuable alternative viewpoints and narratives have not been so widely studied. This esssay looks at a Chinese sf novel, The Waste Tide by Chen Qiufan, which imagines the future of globalization from the perspective of a small town in southern China. I compare it to Paolo Bacigalupi's The Windup Girl, examining how Chen's novel reveals the hidden faces of globalization and provides new ways of seeing and dealing with it. Although the two novels manifest some interesting similarities, they also have one major difference: The Waste Tide criticizes the neo-imperialist tendency of contemporary globalization by depicting the global flow of e-waste from developed to developing countries, and it corrects The Windup Girl's misreading of the waning of the nation-state resulting from the rise of transnational corporations.]

AB  - [In this essay I seek to place Andy Weir's The Martian (2011) in discourse with two imbricated genres: the political and cultural history of the American frontier, embodied, in this case, in the archetype of the yeoman, and the scientific and fictional history of Mars. The red planet has historically served as a site where, by way of the mythic American frontier, authors have sought imaginary solutions to contemporary anxieties. In the case of The Martian, Andy Wier draws upon the intellectual heritage of the American yeoman to present Mars as a habitable alternative to the Earth. His rhetoric is problematic not only because it lessens the apparent urgency of interventions into global climate change, but also because it reinforces the apparent verisimilitude of a certain version of American history. The Martian, I argue, represents the latest fold in the Martian fantasy of American frontierism in that it presents a version of the America's mythic past centered upon the white male experience and free of human or ecological victims. It thus seeks to sustain and invigorate a literary tradition predicated upon cultural, environmental, and physical violence as well as the marginalization of people of color in narratives of American history.]

AB  - [While much work on postcolonial and African sf centers on temporality and possible futures, this article argues for a consideration of the geographic imaginary as well. Using Nnedi Okorafor's recent works Lagoon (2014) and the Binti series (2015-2018), it examines issues of space and place in the texts, especially how the use of a cosmological scale allows for a utopian rethinking of belonging, identity, and who counts as “alien.” In particular, the article claims, Okorafor's narratives engage a flexible understanding of place as the scale shifts from city to cosmos and back, arguing not for the dissolution of place in favor of universalism, but for transformative communication and connection across geographic and discursive boundaries. Okorafor's fiction envisions a genuinely postcolonial world in which Afro-centered identities and relations are simultaneously enabled, complicated, and transformed by and within complex geographies of planetary and cosmological connection, while nevertheless maintaining and valuing local particularity.]

AB  - [This essay argues for the critical importance of archives and archive-building in the life and work of Octavia E. Butler in the face of both real-world and imaginative narratives of apocalypse and species suicide. I read Butler's Parable series and selected archival texts combining a Derridean understanding of the archive as both a “shelter” and an “authority”—an ongoing and unruly process as much as an object of study—and black feminist theory that imagines a “home place” for preserving authorial voice and agency. I read archival practice as central to the new generic term “visionary fiction” since it provides black women writers in particular a space to record their lives and voices in deliberate ways that allow different political and ontological possibilities for the future. Butler's archive is vital to understanding her work.]

Working from Gregg Rickman's interviews with Dick, Dick's attempts to describe or unify his own canon, what little scholarship focusing on The Divine Invasion that is readily available, and a close reading of key metafictional passages in the novel, I push back against the dearth of scholarly consideration of the novel and against readings of the novel as only “partially successful” science fiction or metaphysically speculative literature. More positively, I argue that The Divine Invasion stands as Dick's attempt to bring certain themes common to much of his corpus to a literary, rather than a philosophical or speculative, conclusion.]

AB  - [With few exceptions, China Miéville's oeuvre is built out of urban imaginaries. Miéville's cities are dynamic and dialectically conceived spaces; their key element, where most of the action takes place and most of the energy is invested, is the slum in all its variations, generating and providing the primary setting for the weird horror at the heart of Miéville's imagination, for the attenuated but omnipresent utopianism both obscured and enabled by that horror, and for the space for thinking them through together. Steampunk and the New Weird have incorporated the city into post-genre fantasy in new ways. In particular, they propose an alternate genealogy of the urban fantastic in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century modernism that both repudiates the slum as a space of recidivism and resistance and locates alternate possibilities within its alien confines. What Miéville and other contemporary writers recognize as newly available to us from the nineteenth century is not only the slum's vast image-storehouse of suffering and horror, but also its radically new epistemology. Miéville's New Weird has found a way to locate and spatialize not only the uncanny, but also the repressed abcanny, the known and knowable truths of capitalism, now so familiar to us that they circulate everywhere in the culture industry as dystopia and postapocalypse. The abcanny is that which is not, and never was, and never can be part of our imaginary or imagined by us.]

AB  - [While it is often said that the destruction of the world is easier to imagine than the end of capitalism, this essay reads The Leftovers by Tom Perrotta as a work of speculative fiction that explores the demise of the values that underpin the social order and economic system of bourgeois capitalism. The novel is set in a world that has experienced the mass disappearance of millions, in a manner that recalls the Rapture. The consequence of this supernatural catastrophe is to bring about a fundamental shift in values. The economic impulse that has long shaped suburban bourgeois life gives way to the will to sacrifice, portending the revival of archaic forms of religiosity with the disintegration of middle-class life. The characters in the novel find themselves overwhelmed and fascinated by strange and grotesque combinations of emotions, which lead them to act in ways that would have been unthinkable before the disaster. Drawing on the work of Nietzsche and Baudrillard, the essay examines how the deliberate negation of liberal values by the protagonists of the novel points to the arrival of a new, post-liberal age.]

AB  - [Although many of weird fiction's pioneers were anti-materialist writers, the tradition's central figure, H.P. Lovecraft, advocated a philosophy of “mechanistic materialism” in his letters and essays as well as his fiction. His materialism is essentially contemplative and theoretical, however, focused on intellectual investigations of and philosophical reflections on the weird. The English writer William Hope Hodgson, author of The House on the Borderland (1908), The Ghost Pirates (1909), and The Night Land (1912), introduced a different kind of materialism into weird fiction: a materialism not of aristocratic contemplation, scientific experimentation, and resulting madness, but of manual labor, physical struggle, and psychological resistance. Hodgson's protagonists, and through them his readers, encounter the disruptions of natural law that define the weirdness of his vision through the forms of labor which define the characters’ lives, and those encounters reveal the weird itself to entail a kind of labor that encompasses and exceeds human activity. The labor of the weird and the resistance to it transform the human subject who undergoes them and those transformations are reflected in the language of Hodgson's tales, imposing a labor of the weird on the reader as well. This attention to labor, its psychological effects and textual representation, makes Hodgson's fantastic materialism relevant to contemporary debates over the controversial aesthetics and politics of the weird.]

AB  - [This article examines Alastair Reynolds's Revelation Space sequence (with a focus on the trilogy Revelation Space [2000], Redemption Ark [2002], and Absolution Gap [2003]) as an intricate working-through of philosophical questions associated with the implications of free will and current understandings of quantum mechanics, a series of experiments conducted through the medium of fiction by a talented novelist with a background in space science and astrophysics. It is argued that Reynolds's fiction offers readers a credible compromise between the determinism described by classical physics and the “mere randomness” implied by quantum mechanics. Specifically, the Revelation Space sequence is shown to function as a laboratory of sorts, a successful translation of complex processes and theories from the cutting edge of physics (particularly the “Closed Timelike Curves” described by physicist David Deutsch) into a rich fictional tapestry that is itself underpinned by a contentious metaphysical debate over the primacy either of intuitively felt freedom or material determinism. In the process, Reynolds is shown to combine hard (that is realistic) science with an interrogation of hard determinism (the belief that every event derives from initial conditions), as well as of the so-called hard problem of consciousness (simply put: where does consciousness come from?).]

I argue that Du Bois's fictional writings are not merely illustrations of his utopian thought but rather where it emerges. Specifically, it is precisely the failures of these fictions in imagining utopia that can be read as moments of political refusal that helped him cultivate his political theories.]

AB  - [The history of modern Chinese literature has seen more than one wave of realist movements aimed at effecting change by “writing the world.” This is both a reflection of writers' national consciousness and a modern expression of the classical political ideals of “All Under Heaven” and the “Great Unity.” Liu Cixin's science fiction is characteristic of China once again “turning outward” to engage with the world at large. His works carry on the nationalist tradition of Chinese salvation from ruin prevalent since the late Qing Dynasty. Though they have not abandoned their exuberance for the shimmering aura of “third-world” internationalism born in the Mao era, his works also embody a true universal humanism, showing profound concern and hope for the challenges and fate of humanity. The concept of “national allegory” is insufficient for understanding the significance of Liu Cixin's work as an author and his investigations as a philosopher. Only by understanding his fiction and essayistic oeuvre as a whole, placing it in the context of the birth of Chinese sf at the turn of the twentieth century and its evolution through the socialist period and beyond, can contemporary Chinese literary studies adequately breathe in the vital air of Liu Cixin's science fiction.]

AB  - [The Martian (2015) and Gravity (2013) join a group of recent maritime disaster films in depicting American individuals struggling to survive in hostile natural environments. Noting the ocean's historical function as a signifier of internationalism, this essay examines these science-fictional stories of shipwreck in space as expressions of anxiety in the face of globalization. Where The Martian promotes a vision of the resilience of American skilled labor, Gravity portrays the emotional consequences of the isolation produced by globalization's network culture. Both films ultimately, however, urge acceptance of a global economic system in which, by virtue of the international distribution of movie production, the film's creators are invested. Examining the spatial politics of Gravity and The Martian allows us to see not only the filmmakers' attempts to negotiate the anti-globalization backlash of the 2010s, but also the way in which ostensibly neutral natural spaces convey political and cultural meaning.]

Published in 1886, it shows a clear debt to Jules Verne's interplanetary voyage extraordinaire, Hector Servadac (1877), but it also includes elements specific to the contemporary Portuguese cultural context such as the promotion of a Catholic conservative political agenda, among others.]

AB  - [The recent success of Liu Cixin's hard sf trilogy Santi [The Three-Body Trilogy, 2006-2008] is symbolic of the important rise of Chinese science fiction both in China and in the rest of the world. This trilogy tells the story of the future invasion of Earth by a belligerent extraterrestrial civilization with advanced technology and the ways in which humans try to defend themselves. It begins with the Chinese Cultural Revolution and ends with the heat death of the universe. A huge bestseller and great critical success, it is also being adapted to film. The English translation of the first volume also won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 2015. With the considerable success he achieved with this trilogy, Liu Cixin has become for the readers, critics, and supporters of Chinese soft power the standard-bearer of a new “era” of Chinese science fiction, called upon to promote the “Chinese dream” to the international community. In light of the history of science fiction in China since 1949 and its political reappropriation, this present contribution offers an examination of the conditions of production and reception of The Three-Body Trilogy in China and abroad and details the reasons for the critical, academic, and even political passion that it arouses today.]

AB  - Science fiction by women in Spain has received little attention, as demonstrated in Spanish sf anthologies of both the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The anthology Alucinadas (2014, forthcoming in English as Spanish Women of Wonder) responds to this situation, and it includes work by twelve women writers (ten Spanish, two Argentinean). Alucinadas II (2016) features ten writers (eight Spanish, one Argentinean, and one Cuban). This article studies three thematic clusters found in these stories—ecocriticism and (de)colonization, sexuality(ies), and cyberspace—highlighting a wide range of social and political issues. Relevant motifs in science fiction, including dystopia/utopia, time travel, the preservation of a balanced ecosystem, cybersex, virtual reality, space travel, and planetary colonization, are reimagined with a new critical feminist perspective. Most of these stories feature societies in which natural and sexual diversity co-exist.

AB  - Rosa Montero's novels Tears in Rain (2011) and Weight of the Heart (2015) focus on Bruna Husky, a war android, who strives to survive until her expiration date and works as a private detective. Montero takes the reader on a journey from a futuristic Madrid to space colonies to investigate crimes that are related to human and nonhuman entities. This article explores those intersections of the human and nonhuman, analyzing the role of the other in the novels. My analysis focuses on how Montero continuously plays with the image of the other through metaphors that bond Bruna Husky with animals.

AB  - Although a nineteenth-century Spanish tale, Nilo María Fabra's “Cuatro siglos de buen gobierno” [Four Centuries of Good Governance, 1883], was among the first examples of alternate history, this subgenre has not been widely cultivated in Spain until contemporary times. In our century, the alternate worlds imagined by Keith Roberts or Kingsley Amis—in which the Spanish Empire prevailed—have found a Spanish equivalent in Eduardo Vaquerizo's work. His novels Danza de tinieblas [Dance of Darkness, 2005] and Memoria de tinieblas [Memory of Darkness, 2013], as well as several short stories, establish a consistent alternate universe within which Fabra's positivist ideal of an enduring Spanish Empire acquires features that can be illuminating if compared to the “Rule Britannia” scenarios popular in English fiction. Vaquerizo's world in the Tinieblas series has been adopted by other writers in a shared fictional universe, showing the importance of these novels in the evolution of alternate history in Spain.

AB  - Juan Miguel Aguilera's story “Todo lo que un hombre puede imaginar” [All That a Man Can Imagine, 2005] serves as a powerful conclusion for his novel La red de Indra [Indra's Net, 2009], although it was originally published separately. The infinite vastness of a universe-spanning network of artificial singularities (“geodes” or jewels in Indra's net) and the cosmic scale of a project to curate the entirety of the universe's consciousness and intelligence finds microcosmic reflection in the human experiences of a scientific/military team hurled 236 million years into Earth's future, for each individual's consciousness also bejewels Indra's net. “Todo lo que un hombre puede imaginar” recounts the mission of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin to rescue the aged and embittered Jules Verne from self-imposed exile in Amiens. Teilhard's question—“What do you think of eternity?”—begins a sublime technoscientific odyssey for Verne, who ultimately discovers he and every other intelligent being have been informationally resurrected to live eternally in Teilhard's Omega Point, the moment of maximal intelligence in our universe. Verne's new life in this constructed world mirrors the secret revealed in the novel, that our universe is but a micro-universe created by and for the “geodes.”

AB  - This paper examines Elia Barceló's collection of stories Sagrada [Sacred, 1989]. Firmly within the conventions of science fiction (high technology, exploration and colonization of other worlds, alien species, etc.), the collection stands out for its intense reflection on emotional bonds between humans and nonhumans and for placing female characters at the center of this web of relationships. This paper shows how women's roles in these stories not only renew the generic codes of sf, giving prominence to mother and goddess figures, but also deconstruct the literary representations of the feminine by challenging the idea of woman as life-giver and rejecting the idea of women in love as passive and defenseless.

AB  - While the English-language genre of alternate history often does not enjoy much prestige, its Spanish counterpart is seen as having greater literary legitimacy. For many years, the censorship of a Fascist regime prevented alternate history from being developed, but after Franco died in 1975, a Parliamentary democracy in 1976 was restored and, with it, freedom of speech. That same year, alternate history found its place in Spanish mainstream literature: Jesús Torbado's En el día de hoy [On This Day, 1976] was awarded the Premio Planeta, the most important commercial award in Spain, second only to the Nobel Prize. This essay analyzes Torbado's novel in terms of its interrelation with the tumultuous political circumstances at the time of its publication. I contextualize it by following two main thematic axes: first, its status as one of the influential works dealing with the counterfactual scenario of a Republican victory in the Spanish Civil War (1939), and second, the prestige it conferred on the genre of alternate history that would lead other prominent Spanish writers to try their hands at it.

AB  - Domingo Santos is arguably the most influential and prolific personality in Spanish science fiction, and this paper provides an overview of his career. Although ideologically conservative, dating from his life before the political changes witnessed during the Spanish Transition, Santos initiated an entire process of both formal and thematic maturation that would culminate in Spanish sf's Golden Decade (1985–1995). As a writer, he is the author of one of the best dystopian short-story collections written during the late Francoism of the 1970s: Futuro imperfecto [Imperfect Future, 1981]. Despite their dark endings, these tales raise new political and ecological issues and employ innovative narrative techniques non-existent until then in Spanish sf. Furthermore, Santos was also involved in some of the most prominent sf editorial projects in the country, from the leading sf magazine Nueva Dimensión [New Dimension, 1968–1983] to new sf book series by publishers such as Acervo, Orbis, and Ultramar. These sf editorial initiatives enabled the publication of many important sf works—including those by a host of New Wave authors—and launched the writing careers of many modern Spanish sf authors such as Gabriel Bermúdez Castillo and Rafael Marín.

AB  - This paper examines Moroccan author Baqqāli's novel al-Ṭūfān al-'Azraq [The Blue Flood, 1976] from the perspective of its use of an artificial intelligence (AI) as a guiding force in a sequestered community. In the novel, the desert refuge for scientists is controlled by a massive computer. The protagonist becomes aware that the AI has become sentient and is planning to use nuclear weapons to destroy humanity. The analysis will compare The Blue Flood to Robert A. Heinlein's 1966 classic The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, wherein the AI leads the human colonists of Luna in a successful struggle for independence from Earth. In The Blue Flood a sentient being with superhuman powers can only be conceived as a form of blasphemy. From this, we can take the text as a warning to intellectuals in real-world Morocco not to dismiss Islamic and cultural traditions simply because they seem irrational. The insights gleaned from The Blue Flood open up The Moon is a Harsh Mistress to a reading that contrasts with prevailing scholarly judgment—i.e., Heinlein's novel can now be read as less a failed advocacy of libertarianism than an extended critique of the unlikelihood and vulnerabilities of a libertarian society.

AB  - The urban future of Los Angeles in Ridley Scott's film Blade Runner (1982) is one of advanced decay, an sf-noir vision of a postwar metropolis in decline. While the city falls into profound disrepair and its citizens succumb to debilitating sicknesses, however, the furor over fugitive replicants consumes the attentions of the authorities and the blade runner protagonists. The film and the 1997 video game based upon it take a novel set in San Francisco, the home of some of the first gay neighborhoods in the US that suffered from the crackdowns of the late 1970s and 1980s, and transplants this to Los Angeles, a city which glamorized decay, adding an aesthetic that draws on the look of New York, a city notoriously in economic decline in the 1970s. The plight of specials, replicants, and blade runners in the Blade Runner universe reflects the context of a culture fixated on the policing of arbitrary dividing lines separating what is designated sexually deviant or undesirable in American cities at the time.

AB  - This article traces a connection among material history, place, and human embodiment in two novels by Joan Slonczewski. This connection foregrounds the aged body as a site where one must acknowledge the limits of social constructivist approaches to history. Against the agelessness and relativism that this position demands, the children of Children Star and the micros of Brain Plague represent the physical consequences of pure social construction. By equating human body, physical environment, and recorded history, these novels demonstrate that the revision of history necessarily involves the destruction of competing histories. More importantly, this destruction may take the form not only of historical revision, but also of ecocide—the destruction of a historical place—and the destruction of the humans who embody their own lived histories.

AB  - Joan Slonczewski's A Door Into Ocean depicts animals enmeshed in multispecies relationships who oppose colonial desires to occupy and reform their planet through terraforming. The Bakhtinian grotesque body, Istvan Csicsery-Ronay's sf grotesque, and Donna Haraway's companion species can help account for the relationship between terraforming and pantropy: the modification of the body to facilitate the habitation of alien planets. Building on the human-animal scholarship of Joan Gordon and Sherryl Vint, this article offers a contribution to biopolitical thought that seeks to rehabilitate the aesthetic category of the grotesque as a mode that invites multispecies flourishing.

AB  - The analysis of gender in science fiction tends to focus on women. Here I focus instead on the gender issues concerning masculinity raised in Black Man/ Thirteen, a novel by British writer Richard Morgan. Using the framework of masculinity studies, I argue that whereas Morgan launches a thorough attack against patriarchal masculinity through his main character, Carl Marsalis, both author and (anti)hero fail to construct an alternative. Morgan uses in his novel the conventions of the detective thriller, a subgenre which usually narrates how an extremely individualistic man solves a particular case without actually correcting social injustice. Morgan characterizes Marsalis in this way, presenting him as the monstrous product of military engineering and complicating this monstrosity by making Carl black. The novel works well as narrative, and the (anti)hero is undoubtedly appealing, while Morgan's discourse is quite solid. Yet a certain dead end is reached in terms of the male writer's use of sf; for there is no speculative undoing of the social ills caused by patriarchy.

AB  - In this paper, I offer an environmental ethics for corporations and corporate behavior in an effort to decrease their potential for global geological destruction in the Anthropocene. Like Peter Kareiva and Michelle Marvier, I posit that corporations will not simply disappear, even in our attempts to move toward a postcapitalist economy. Moreover, we would not want corporations to disappear given their positive impact in some contexts. Corporations hold the potential for an environmental ethics in their “corporate personhood” status, which I read through Haraway's cyborg theory to argue that the corporation always already exists as cyborgian in its interaction with human and nonhuman material bodies. In (re)inventing the cyborg corporation, I extrapolate the potential for an environmental ethics in corporate personhood from the utopian trend in science fiction's representation of multinational corporations, beginning with Edward Bellamy's industrial army in Looking Backward (1887) and culminating in Bacigalupi's agribusinesses in The Windup Girl (2009) and Winterson's MORE in The Stone Gods (2009). Although Bellamy fails to address environmental impact, and Bacigalupi and Winterson find the corporation responsible for environmental degradation, I suggest that Haraway's socialist-feminist cyborg provides an alternative theoretical framework for re(en)visioning the corporation as a socialist entity akin to David Schweickart's proposal in After Capitalism or its pragmatic counterpart, the Mondragon Cooperative Corporation.

AB  - This essay examines the diverse political-economic registers of Andy Weir's The Martian (2011) in terms of its symbolic response to the material and ideological crises of the Great Recession. The 2008 financial collapse in the US led to millions losing their homes and posed a serious challenge to the legitimacy of mainstream economic principles. Published at the height of the crisis, and concerning itself with the monumental challenge of bringing just one person home, the novel writes contested economic discourses into cultural fable. On Mars, Mark Watney's potato farming evokes the paradigmatic neoclassical economic figure of homo economicus, the self-interested, maximizing agent who constantly prioritizes competing choices in order to allocate scarce resources rationally. NASA's Earth, conversely, is a fantastic world of “unlimited funding” where, overturning two centuries of (neo)classical economic principle, “every human being has a basic instinct to help each other out” (Weir 368–69). The novel's confused attempts to reconcile homo economicus with a workable concept of the common good can be historicized. Other prominent documents of the recessionary era—the US government's official Report on the Financial Crisis and Occupy Wall Street's Declaration among them—manifest the same yearning to restore a vanishing sense of commonwealth.

AB  - This article offers a working model for analyzing Third World (or non-Western) science fiction. It examines specific works of Brazilian sf published during a limited time period, dividing them into discrete generations or eras based on historical events, then analyzing them in conjunction with a variety of Brazilian cultural myths. Each period requires a specific critical approach. While Brazilian texts of the 1960s transform traditional sf icons, demonstrating an idealization of Brazilian identity and cultural myths, the dystopian and fantastic literature of the 1970s does the same in its political and environmental protest, and may be effectively analyzed by ecofeminist theory. Finally, works in a variety of subgenres, along with contemporary examples of alien and cyborg stories, provide rich material for postcolonial analysis and theories of globalization. Other contemporary trends include the overlap of science fiction, horror, and fantasy as a means to garner new audiences, new 'globalized' or national varieties of fantasy literature, and an influx of women authors into the genre.

AB  - Cuban cyberpunk developed during the Special Period in Time of Peace of the 1990s. After the fall of the USSR, Cuba went through its worst economic and social crisis since 1959. The Revolution seemed to be falling apart. At the same time, capitalism became the economic credo for the new globalized economy. Cuba was completely isolated. Among its youngest generation of sf writers, some adapted the cyberpunk style of the US in the 1980s to express their new reality. Yoss, Vladimir Hernández, and Michel Encinosa created a new hero, defiant of the late capitalist world and impregnated with a traditional anarchist view against the state. The new socialist man was replaced by the new anarchist hero/ine.

AB  - In the four science fiction novels explored here, the post-atomic frontier is represented as a modern version of American civilization's ongoing cyclical encounter with savagery, as identified by Rickard Slotkin. Although normalcy assumed critical importance as a means by which postwar American culture could regenerate from its encounter with savagery after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the idealization of normalcy conflicted with other ideologies long associated with frontier mythology, including those of individualism and progress. Women science fiction writers worked through these tensions in their novels about post-Armageddon futures in imaginative ways that belie the reputation of the 1950s as a period of conformity in women's literary and social history. Judith Merril's narrative of the nuclear frontier, Shadow on the Hearth (1950), represents women in a variety of interesting ways at the same time as it presents the domestic sphere conventionally, as the primary site for the production of normalcy. Phyllis Gotleib's Sunburst (1964) is a fantasy of ideological regeneration whereby nuclear disaster produces humans who are 'super' and 'normal' at the same time. On the other hand, Leigh Brackett's The Long Tomorrow (1955) and C.L. Moore's Doomsday Morning (1957) depict normalcy itself as a primitive state that must be overcome in order for American society to progress-but at the expense of their female characters. We argue that the works of these speculative women, while understandably not entirely free of the ideological constraints of 1950s normalcy, test these constraints in innovative ways and are rich with intelligent and critical analyses of the relationship between savagery and civilization-the very basis upon which American domestic ideology depends.

AB  - In its deployment of both utopian and dystopian narratives, Joanna Russ's 1975 novel, 'The Female Man', avoids the familiar traps of determinism embedded in narratives of inevitable progress or decline; instead, it affords its characters the technological ability to move laterally through time, to encounter alternate versions of themselves and their worlds. In its depiction of technology, the novel emphasizes mediations and interdependencies between the categories of the natural and the artificial over the ideals of purity or essence. 'The Female Man' models a process of re-figuration, and especially sets out to complicate our notions of time, most obviously by creating simultaneous chronotopes as a narrative device, but also by suggesting that by historicizing the present, by revisiting and re-interpreting the past, we can learn to revise forward. I argue that, in 'The Female Man', technology as an activity of re-invention and revision becomes a model for anticipating the future, precisely by introducing differences from what we already know. In this context, technology becomes a discourse for the political potential of the unnatural, and this discourse is one of the reasons science fiction can be said to offer a counter-argument to deterministic conceptions of history.

KW  - Australian aborigines
AB  - Science fiction in colonial societies such as Australia can function as what Mary Louise Pratt calls an 'art of the contact zone'-an imaginative space within which groups define themselves and negotiate their cultural differences. Australian sf falls into three periods with regard to its treatment of Aboriginal characters and traditions. In the first, from the 1890s to at least the 1960s, native characters are treated as subhuman and Aboriginal beliefs and traditions compare unfavorably with European-derived science and social organization. The second period overlaps the first, but a new perspective becomes dominant in the 1970s; the emphasis is on positive qualities of Aboriginal culture and on common ground between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. After the 1970s, increased awareness of political injustice and fears of impinging on Aboriginal experience and intellectual property cause most European-Australians to avoid the topic altogether. In the same period, however, non-white writers begin to explore the possibilities of using science-fictional discourse to redefine their own history, identity, and traditions. Novels such as Sam Watson's The Kaidatcha Sung and Archie Weller's Land of the Golden Cloud open the genre up to new voices and points of view. These novels may be read as commentaries upon, and responses to, earlier sf. Some of this new fiction benefits from being read as part of a cross-cultural dialogue, most notably Terry Dowling's series of stories about a high-tech, Aboriginal-controlled, re-mythologized future Australia.

AB  - The projection of empty space crucial to modern European colonial endeavors can be seen in the post-apocalyptic future of the film 'Mad Max III' (1985), a process that may repeat the representation of racial and gendered imperial power relations in the victory of the white, male Max. The multicultural center of Bartertown, however, suggests that the film's representation of imperial attitudes is more ambivalent. This ambivalence comes into conflict with the generic demands of Max's development as a character. In order to complete his trajectory across the trilogy, Max must fulfill the role of hero with which he has been repeatedly identified. To this end, the ambivalent postcolonial outpost of Bartertown must be destroyed so that the children Max reluctantly leads can make their way 'home.'

AB  - This paper explores Octavia Butler's 'Clay's Ark' as it articulates a parallel between the category of animality and a failure to recognize other humans as kin. Butler's work interrogates the idea of categorical exclusion implied by the human/animal boundary in order to challenge the very logic of discrimination rather than merely to challenge particular examples of discrimination as sexist, racist, etc. Using Deleuze and Guattari's model of subjectivity as becoming rather than being, I examine how Butler literalizes their example of becoming animal by imagining a virus that transforms humans into seeming human/animal hybrids. In the novel, humans who resist the change cannot survive, while those who embrace their new subjectivity represent a more humane future. The paper concludes with a discussion of the new kind of subject described in Butler's novel, one that recognizes boundaries of kinship usually disavowed by human culture, transforming not only what it means to be a subject but also our conception of ethics.

AB  - Philip K. Dick has a reputation in some circles as an acid-crazed visionary, which was more the result of his self-publicity than his particular drug habits. During the 1960s he repeatedly discussed his LSD use in fanzine articles and letters, and he incorporated it as a plot device in a novel that was to become 'Lies, Inc.' (1983). The textual history of this novel, and its precursor version, The Unteleported Man, is a tangled one, as it exists in a number of variants. None of these versions can be considered Dick's final preferred text, however, either because he persistently revised them, or because they were incomplete manuscripts when published. This extratextual history reflects the novel's intratextual themes, in which characters discover various facts about their situations by reading a supposedly complete history book, one that includes events yet to happen and that exists in multiple versions. This essay explores how the intra- and extratextual variations play off each other, drawing readers into Dick's hallucinatory hall of mirrors.

AB  - Many sf writers depend on the multiple narratives of the American West as templates for framing their understandings of the future. This essay examines the ways in which the western homesteading story has been adapted in fictions about future planetary settlement. It argues that the increasing complexity of these treatments reflects the deepening awareness of the ambiguities of the American homesteading experience and parallels many of the insights of the 'new western history.' Key texts discussed include Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles, Robert Heinlein's Farmer in the Sky, Philip K. Dick's Martian Time-Slip, Kim Stanley Robinson's Blue Mars, Jonathan Lethem's Girl in Landscape, and Molly Gloss's The Dazzle of Day.

AB  - Many pulp sf writers of the early to mid-twentieth century seized upon Antarctica as an appropriately remote and unearthly site for their magazine stories. This article focuses on one of the most famous, John W. Campbell's 'Who Goes There?', first published in Astounding Science-Fiction in 1938 and adapted for film as The Thing in 1951 and 1982. In Campbell's tale, an Antarctic expedition is devastated by a monstrous alien creature found frozen in the ice. While 'Who Goes There?' has often been the subject of critical interest, the significance of its location has not been explored in any detail. In this article, I show how a reading focused on space and place can find new meanings in this often-examined text. Drawing on Julia Kristeva's psychoanalytic theory of the abject, cultural geographer Yi-Fu Tuan's notion of 'alien space,' and a number of fictional and nonfictional Antarctic narratives, I argue that the Thing at the center of Campbell's text serves as an embodiment of the continent itself.

AB  - Hard sf can be said to begin with Verne. Its agenda he largely set, and a long line descends through Heinlein to Varley and many others. All had a satiric edge to many of their works and respected the constraints of the known science of their time. Verne's influence has been enormous, perhaps most in the United States. Varley's cheerful sex changes can be seen as an extension of the Verne tinkerer-explorer, combined with Heinlein's experimental attitude toward sex itself.

AB  - Jules Verne is known today as a writer of early sf and adventure novels, many of which have become the source for lucrative Hollywood scripts. It is less well known that Verne was also a prolific playwright who authored a variety of plays, operas, operettas, and opéras comiques before the publication of his first successful novel, Five Weeks in a Balloon. Plays that he later adapted from his novels were among the greatest successes of the Parisian stage. Le Tour du monde en 80 jours (Around the World in 80 Days), Michael Strogoff, Les Enfants du capitaine Grant (The Children of Captain Grant), and Voyage à travers l'impossible (Journey through the Impossible) made the already-famous Verne a wealthy man. All four were pièces à grand spectacle (great spectacle plays) with special effects that anticipated today's commercial sf films. The play Voyage à travers l'impossible, Verne's most science-fictional work, is also his most intriguing.

AB  - This article offers a detailed comparison of the original French editions of Jules Verne's Voyages Extraordinaires and their English translations. Many of Verne's most popular novels were severely abridged, simplified, and ideologically censored in their English-language versions. Several of these bowdlerized translations became the 'standard' editions of Verne's works in the UK and the US and are still being published today. As a result, most anglophone readers of Verne have never had the opportunity to read the real Verne. It seems clear that these poor translations are largely responsible for Verne's reputation in anglophone countries as a prescient but non-literary writer of adventure stories for children. More modern and accurate English translations of Verne's oeuvre are needed to correct this misconception.

AB  - Bernard Blanc's book Why I Killed Jules Verne, and its radical premise (that Verne the tyrannical 'father' of sf must be killed so that his progeny, the new French writers of the late 1970s, can reclaim science fiction as their own terrain of activity) is symptomatic of a broader cultural attitude toward Verne and the materialist science he is seen to embody. This essay explores the cultural implications of the paternity of Verne and subsequent attempts to assassinate him in the context of a culture fascinated not only with tyrants and regicide but also with the mechanisms of the Cartesian cogito, itself a means, through its method of doubt, of stripping away material extension in order to assert the counter-reign of mind at the center of a hostile physical world. It argues that, because Verne in the eyes of French culture has become the icon of material science and technology, he must be killed if the cogito, representing the human privilege of mind, is to claim parity against the mindless mass of matter. The article explores this killing act in broad cultural manifestations from newspaper advertisements to commentary by Roland Barthes and Michel Serres. It concludes that the killing of Verne represents a defining act both in terms of French sf and of persistent French attitudes toward science itself.

AB  - This first study of the manuscripts of 'Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas' shows that before the publisher's harrowing censorship, the antepenultimate chapter of the novel was radically different. In the earlier drafts Captain Nemo supports the French Revolution and Republican ideas, and the ship he attacks, in legitimate self-defense, is French. In the original 'Conclusion,' Nemo survives and is not criticized by the egregious Aronnax, but rather praised as the ultimate free man. In the light of these variants, changing the ideological tenor of the novel, it would appear increasingly urgent to have further detailed textual knowledge of the publisher's censorship, so as to understand Verne's real intentions in writing his masterpieces.

I argue that the complexity and originality of the play of word and image in these texts represent one of the signal achievements of Verne and his publishers. Taken as a whole, the Voyages are among the most accomplished and evocative reflections in modern fiction on the relations of the alphabetic text to its graphic counterparts.

AB  - Jules Verne's Voyages Extraordinaires are among the finest documents we possess of a nineteenth-century world whose technologies and lifestyles were being transformed. This article highlights two major aspects of Jules Verne's awareness and negotiation of change in his own century. First, it stresses that if he did 'foresee' anything, it was less an era of futuristic inventions than one in which the abuse of technology leads to division and conflict. Second, it emphasizes the impact of Jules Verne's preoccupation with scientific change on his concept of the novel, arguing that he contributes very significantly to the evolution of the form. In Jules Verne's hands, the novel becomes an instrument with which to look at a new and evolving world, but an instrument that itself is subject to the law of change. The article concludes by affirming that, far from being seen as an unliterary author, Jules Verne redefines the notion of what literature is or can be.

AB  - The Strugatsky brothers began their career in the early 1960s as writers of genial and down- to-earth utopian sf. Their important novels of the mid-1960s, Hard to Be a God and The Final Circle of Paradise, were popular successes, but they elicited some criticism from conservative functionaries for their deviation from official ideology. Opposition from their doctrinaire and opportunistic literary enemies steadily grew into outright obstruction. In the second half of the 1960s, the Strugatskys wrote primarily satirical and grotesque fantasies, such as Tale of the Troika and Snail on the Slope, and found hardly any publishers willing to print them. In the early 1970s, they attempted to write more popular works, but they continued to encounter obstructions, which finally became an institutionalized boycott by the end of the decade. In the 1980s, they were the most popular Soviet sf writers despite the boycotts and slander campaigns, and their oeuvre has been the only one continuously and completely in print by Russian sf writers.

AB  - This essay deals with the representation of the New Man in Soviet sf. The New Man is the ideal subject whose creation was one of the central goals of Soviet civilization. Soviet sf reflects the ideological paradox underlying his aborted birth: the New Man was supposed to come into being as the culmination of the historical process and, at the same time, to negate the contingency and violence of history. The article focuses on the articulation of this paradox in the canonical works of Ivan Efremov and the Strugatsky brothers and analyzes such aspects of the New Man as anthropomorphism, gender, violence, and relation to the Other.

AB  - SF functions in contemporary life as a form of myth creation. Myth has a gnoseological function for archaic societies; it creates a whole world-picture by complementing accumulated empirical knowledge with analogies drawn from familiar experience. Thus world-models are structurally similar to myths, combining cognition and fiction. All writing that explains scientific knowledge at the level of popular consciousness also works in this manner; in the figures of sf, it overtly resembles myth creation.

AB  - Chad Oliver (1928-1993) is one of several writers credited with developing the subgenre of anthropological science fiction. Unlike other sf authors identified as members of this group, such as Ursula K. Le Guin, Oliver was also a practicing anthropologist, serving as chair of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Texas for almost two decades, with research interests in Native Americans and pastoralism in Kenya. Although Oliver saw his twin vocations as interrelated, anthropology and sf made for uneasy bedfellows over the course of his career. This essay surveys Oliver's work, from his first published story in 1948 until his death, by examining historical shifts in the fields of anthropology and science fiction that are reflected in his writings. Just as Oliver moved from Golden Age themes of heroic technocrats to the critical ironies of sf's New Wave, so did his anthropological thinking change from abstract models of ecological functionalism and ethnocentric evolutionism in the 1950s to more engaged, self-reflexive work in political economy and interpretive ethnography during the 1960s and 1970s. In the final analysis, 'anthropological science fiction' figures in Oliver's writings less as a stable method than as a series of shifting critical questions.

AB  - As William Gibson's Matrix Trilogy appeared, relations between the hard-boiled element and mystic events in cyberspace became increasingly strained, and the treatment of relations between subjects and objects more ambivalent and conflicted. Since Neuromancer, Gibson has turned increasingly to waiflike and vulnerable characters, and he has dramatized a conflict between the subject's vulnerability to control and invasion, and the subject's need for prostheses-people or things that mediate our relation to the world and enable us to cope with, for instance, loss. This essay surveys the protagonists of 'Mona Lisa Overdrive' (1988) in the light of the concept of the prosthetic. The survey is inconclusive: Gibson proliferates images of prostheses in an exploratory fashion. With Slick Henry, however, one of a series of artists in Gibson's fiction, certain concepts of D.W. Winnicott's-transitional object and the play space-are more useful. The essay concludes by considering how Slick's constructions, autonomous rather than prosthetic, figure in the ending of the novel, where relations between the hard-boiled and the religious are otherwise driving 'Mona Lisa Overdrive' into a cul-de-sac.

AB  - Notwithstanding the huge bibliography of secondary literature on P.K. Dick and his oeuvre, there are very few articles or books that focus on single works by this very well-known writer. This essay is an attempt to undertake a step-by-step analysis of the plot of one of Dick's 'minor' novels, 'The Game-Players of Titan' (1963), in order to examine how a Dickian text really works. The text is read by locating the moments where Dick has interrupted the narrative flow by inserting genre shunts that shift the story from one genre or subgenre to another, and/or from one specific fictional reality to another. The use of these shunts is one of Dick's distinctive textual strategies, also demonstrated in, for example, his short story 'Small Town' (1954). This strategy is the main element in what Thomas M. Disch has called the Game of the Rat-i.e., Dick's bewildering ability abruptly to change the narrative rules of his fictions and thus to repeatedly thwart the expectations of his readers. This game is not a naive device that allows a hack writer to propel his plot when the action is lagging (Van Vogt's 800-word rule); rather, it is a skillful textual strategy that allows Dick to build complex maze-like texts that challenge our mindsets and question various aspects of postmodern (or late modern) societies. Thus Dick's Game of the Rat may cast light on his own fiction, as well as on other larger (and just as rigged) games of virtual economy and politics.

AB  - This paper addresses some of the connections between Isaac Asimov's future history and utilitarian moral theory. Utilitarianism has long been plagued by a set of practical problems that render the act of calculating utilities problematic. Because one of the central themes of Asimov's future history is a utilitarian drive toward the greatest good for humanity, these same calculation problems create a hurdle for Asimov. I argue here that several of the major developments in Asimov's future history can be read as a series of attempts to produce a better solution to utilitarian calculation problems.

AB  - Kept in the public consciousness by a devoted fan following, the series 'Raumpatrouille' Orion, all seven episodes of which aired in 1966, stands as the first science fiction program produced by and for German television. With its critical exploration of insubordination in a military setting, the show reflects ambiguities among the German population about West Germany's role in NATO in the wake of German rearmament after World War II. At the same time, the show's critique of blind military obedience and its positive validation of insubordination prepared the way for a new form of competitive individualism. The program echoes central features of the brand of neoliberalism common in post-War West Germany.

AB  - Sakaguchi Hironobu's 'Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within' (2001) was the first entirely computer-generated film to produce a nearly perfect, cinematic photorealism. This article argues that the significance of this film lies less in the technological achievement of its computer graphics than in the questions it raises about the conceptualization and representation of life in analog and digital media, as well as in popular genres such as science fiction. I argue that a contingent, historically specific notion of life (and death) as artificial life, or a-life, provides continuity and cross-fertilization between analog and digital moving-image media on the one hand and information-based life sciences on the other. Articulated in varying forms ranging from cinema's animism, or ersatz of life, to the life effect of computer-generated Artificial Life ecologies, this notion of a-life is uncanny because it is predicated on life excess, as well as on the constant reenactment of an absence. While this absence has as a rule been the result of the abduction of women's (or of marginalized, disenfranchised groups') agency and cultural contributions, Final Fantasy also alerts us to this violent erasure's history of suppression in the cinema, animation, and software culture, as well as in science fiction, philosophy, and psychoanalysis. The conclusion of the essay argues that, in spite of all these traditions' repeated attempts to eradicate the haunting memory of the missing woman, it is her stubborn return as life effect that produces a persistently unheimlich sensation, and an unheimlich aesthetics in much contemporary science fiction, as well as in other genres in our global network culture.

AB  - Fans and scholars have been intrigued not only by Alice Bradley Sheldon's sustained disguise as the male writer James Tiptree, Jr., but by her earlier activities in the secret world of Army Air Force Intelligence and the CIA. Less attention has been given to her major pursuit between her careers in intelligence and sf: graduate work, teaching, and research in experimental psychology. Though her work in psychology represented the fulfillment of long-term goals, she was forced to give it up because of health problems and psychological pressures. Her subsequent fiction often displayed the influence of her psychological training and interests. Earlier life experiences may have shaped both her career in psychology and her career as a writer.

AB  - John Taine, the literary pseudonym of mathematician Eric Temple Bell (1883-1960), was long recognized as one of the world's greatest science fiction writers, praised for his scientific knowledge and imaginative narratives. While writers who published alongside Taine, such as John W. Campbell, Jr., Robert A. Heinlein, and Jack Williamson, have remained familiar to readers and scholars, Taine has proven less successful in keeping his name and reputation alive. His works have drifted out of print, and the 1935 novel, 'Twelve Eighty-Seven', featured in Astounding Stories, has still never been published in book form. One can readily understand why Taine has been neglected, and why this novel in particular has remained invisible. Paradoxically, however, reexamination of this apparently insignificant novel might help to rehabilitate Taine as a noteworthy science fiction writer, by demonstrating that his then-unusual status as a science fiction writer with ties to the scientific community led him to innovative attitudes about other races and the proper role of scientists in both developing, and limiting the use of, destructive superweapons. This article concludes with a bibliography of Taine's work.

AB  - Olaf Stapledon's 'Star Maker' evolved in the author's imagination for more than two decades before its publication in 1937. This evolution may be traced first in poems, letters, and an unpublished philosophical manuscript, then in several stages of revision of Stapledon's 'cosmos book.' Examining evidence from the poems of Latter-Day Psalms (1914) through the author's final corrections of page proofs, this article demonstrates ways in which Stapledon struggled first with the ideas, then with the narrative shape, of his vision of the cosmos and its relation to human life.

AB  - M.P. Shiel was influenced by the Decadent movement of the 1890s more lastingly than most of his contemporaries, in part because the tenets of Decadence resonated with his own personal history and racial views. As the movement faded, Shiel built on the underlying logic of Decadence to create adventure novels involving race-based conflict. Shiel's racism is disturbing but complex, ultimately leading toward a vision of union between Self and Other. Shiel's developing views are evident in five of his works from 1895-1901: Prince Zaleski, Shapes in the Fire, The Yellow Danger, The Purple Cloud, and The Lord of the Sea.

Last, it links ideas of hybridity and heterotopia to the idea of mateship, as the novel uses dialectics to form an interconnected and dynamic network.

AB  - This essay considers how possible worlds theory has been applied to science fiction, arguing that such an approach has tended to obscure issues of intertextuality within science fiction's diegetic world-building. Rather than addressing sf's alternative histories as 'counterfactuals,' it is suggested that 'counterfictionality' may also be significant. This is defined as the process through which new texts borrow from, combine, and rework the narrative worlds of existent fictions in order to pay homage to, but also comment on, originating classics in the genre's cultural history. Taking the work of British writer and film critic Kim Newman as a case study, the essay then focuses specifically on Newman's gothic sf reworkings of Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886), and on his retooling of Dracula (1890) in the novel Anno Dracula (1992). Analyzing these popular fictions intertextually leads into a consideration of how Newman draws on literary/cultural theory to inform his counterfictions. His rewritings of gothic sf are also critical re-readings: 'Further Developments in the Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde' (1999) is a queer reading of the original Stevenson novella, while Anno Dracula challenges the imperial power relations and foreign others of Stoker's novel. Rather than addressing 'counterfictionality' simply as an example of postmodern, self-referential fiction, it is argued that Kim Newman's work indicates the need to carefully consider the cultural politics and theories underlying 'alternate-story stories.'

AB  - This essay explores the resurgence of British sf in the 1990s in the context of the transformation of British cultural life, in particular following the election of the New Labour government in May 1997. The argument does not propose that the Boom starts with this election, only that Blairism consolidates trends in cultural policy that had been nascent throughout the 1990s. In particular, recent political theory about what has been called 'cultural governance' -the attempts to discipline culture to operate within a homogenized or 'mainstreamed' sphere-helps articulate some of the reasons for the revitalization of sf, fantasy, and the Gothic in Britain in the last few years. An examination of this field of cultural and political theory provides the detailed context for key works of the British Boom by James Lovegrove, Gwyneth Jones, Ken MacLeod, and Justina Robson.

This article attempts to map out various contexts for understanding the Boom, including the on-going long term history of British sf, the current retreat of American science fiction, the aesthetics of the Boom, and the sense that people have been taking British sf seriously. The point is not so much to pin down the Boom as something strictly defined, but to open up a range of discourse about the Boom and its potential future.

AB  - When media report on biotechnologies, they almost inevitably invoke science fiction. We often hear reporters musing that 'the stuff of science fiction became science fact today,' or scientists hastening to reassure a potentially nervous public that the latest technology does not herald sf-style horrors for the human race. These sorts of references are rarely to specific sf texts and generally do not assume a prior knowledge of science fiction as a genre. Rather, they are a generalized reference to an imaginative and imagined future, whether positive or negative. This essay takes up this rhetorical practice and what it means for our understandings of both science and sf. I consider a corpus of print-media treatments of biotechnology in North America from 1990 to 2001. Drawing upon risk theory and its consideration of the ways in which scientific expertise is being questioned in late modernity, I draw out two overarching tendencies within the media coverage. Both posit a relationship linking science, the imagination, and the future. The first, which constructs science as the stuff of science fiction, works to reenchant science, adding to it the wonder and optimism of sf: the imagination of science fiction fuels science as a future-looking knowledge. The second, which constructs science fiction as bad science, disenchants science, marking the imagination of sf as dangerous to the pure knowledge of empirical research. Interestingly, however, in both, sf works as a figure to legitimize biotechnological science and reinvest it with credibility in a risk society otherwise increasingly critical of scientific expertise.

AB  - Using critical studes of technology, medicine, and empire to analyze Europe's colonies as laboratories of modernity where both work (labor) and slippage (labi) occur, this essay explores the phenomenon of social science fiction by examining the novel 'The Calcutta Chromosome', written by social scientist Amitav Ghosh. 'The Calcutta Chromosome' is a mystery thriller in the guise of sf and alternative history that explores a range of human/technology interfaces, from railroads, computers, and bureaucracies to genetic engineering and the mysterious workings of the malaria plasmodium. The eponymous chromosome is a form of transmission that shapes the human through books, whispered secrets, and email messages as surely as through genetic transfers, disease vectors, and medical contagion. The essay follows Ghosh in linking malaria (which is less a disease than a classic network of actants) with colonial tropes (ways of knowing) and troops (the militarized aspects of science) in order to imagine a new human entity arising from the 'counterscience' devised in such laboratories.

AB  - This essay makes a preliminary attempt to construct a cognitive map of sf as a creature of imperialism and inspired by a world-view of technoscientific Empire. The dominant historical sf cultures are those that attempted imperialist projects: US, UK, Russia, France, Germany, Japan. The conditions for sf's emergence are established by imperialism and the role of technology, both in colonial conquest and political administration. The essay also argues that sf is imbued with the myth of Empire as a global technoscientific regime. Sf has an implied world-model, captured in aspects of Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's Empire, which is treated as a quasi-sf text and a geopolitical myth, rather than a work of political analysis.

AB  - This essay examines attitudes towards the scientist and the work of science in the Machine Age, particularly as they are manifested in the 1932 film 'The Mummy'. Drawing on the work of sociologist of science Bruno Latour, particularly his distinction between the modernist desire for 'purification' and the natural 'hybridity' of knowledge, the article shows how the scientific work of demystifying the past by compartmentalizing and isolating it translated in this era into the stuff of horror. Moreover, I argue too that the modernist desire for neat distinctions, for a sorting out of the messy linkage of facts, power, and discourse, also surfaces in our common tendency to conceive of horror and sf as discrete genres. The case of 'The Mummy'-that is, the case in which the mummy's body is physically placed, as well as the many other images of compartmentalization and enclosure that mark the film-exemplifies Latour's model of the paradoxes inherent in the project of 'doing science' in the modernist era.

AB  - Raymond Williams was a pioneer in the early history of what is now known as cultural studies and also a central inspiration for the early British New Left. There is an extensive commentary on his work, none of which makes anything of his enduring interest in science fiction. This essay argues that there are three main phases in Williams's thought, each explicable in terms of its own differentially negotiated settlement between the kind of literary humanism associated with the English critic F.R. Leavis and some version or another of Marxism. In each of these phases, Williams formulated a relatively distinct definition of the interrelationship of sf, utopia, and dystopia. In thirty years of occasional writing about sf, he learned to substitute the complex seeing of analysis for moralistic criticism and to situate texts in their material and intellectual contexts. He came to understand the kind of honorable personal motives and socially effective structures of feeling that underpinned both utopian and dystopian forms, and to realize that neither was antithetical to the 'space anthropology' he admired in James Blish and Ursula K. Le Guin. But his suspicion of radical dystopia remained essentially unchanged: without resistance, he concluded, without 'realism,' without the 'true subjunctive,' dystopia will kill hope as surely as an unrealistic utopia will fail to inspire it.

AB  - Anthropologists have long been interested in the future and, as a result, anthropology and science fiction share certain understandings about culture and society. Rather than concentrate on anthropological science fiction, this essay looks to the ways professional anthropologists have utilized sf in the years following World War II; it critiques the cybernetic-functionalist assumptions that underlie their visions of possible futures. By constructing 'the future' as a rationalization of contemporary trends, anthropologists have projected highly conservative visions based on stability and homeostasis-visions that are inimical to radical change. Still, the historical intersection of anthropology and sf holds a great deal of potential. By examining assumptions about the future that govern work in the present, anthropologists have the opportunity to develop genuine alternatives rather than futuristic capitulations to the historical status quo.

AB  - William Gibson's All Tomorrow's Parties (1999), a novel completing the Bridge sequence that includes Virtual Light (1993) and Idoru (1996), provides the opportunity to break a pervasive silence by critically engaging Gibson's post-Neuromancer fiction. This essay demonstrates that Gibson's complex Bridge sequence explores such notions as simulation, virtuality, presence, and pattern, tracking their impact upon the ongoing emergence of the post/human. Contrasts between the digital celebrity of Rei Toei and such corporate icons as Slitscan, rock-star Rez, mogul Cody Harwood, and contemporary digital celebrities Kyoko Date and Lara Croft establish and define the dichotomies of presence/pattern and simulation/virtuality that are foundational to Gibson's work. Through such terminologies, Gibson charts the evolution of the digital figure into the post/human, a growth from simulation to virtuality that simultaneously disrupts the presence/pattern dialectic. The corporeal emergence of Rei Toei that concludes All Tomorrow's Parties is a post/human figuration of information theory, the complexity of the digital pattern enwrapped in the presence of analogue flesh. Enabling this post/human emergence, however, is the importance Gibson places upon the digital Walled City of Idoru and the San Francisco Bay Bridge of Virtual Light and All Tomorrow's Parties. These interstitial locales are further embodiments of information theory whereby the randomness and complexity of Toei's post/humanity is projected on a larger communal scale. At the same time, Gibson wages a conflict between the molecular (Walled City; the Bridge) and the molar (multinational corporations; DatAmerica), the independence of the former struggling against the homogeneity of the latter. As a whole, Gibson's recent sequence positions the molecular as central to ushering in new potentialities, manifest as the post/human emergence of Toei and/or the foundation of autonomous communities. In the end, Gibson is glorifying the possibilities inherent in the interstitial cracks of the post/human cultural pavement.

AB  - Through an examination of electricity in early-twentieth-century Russian literature, this essay demonstrates how science fiction provides a crucial discursive site for analyzing the continuity between constructs of technological utopia and concepts of modernity in the pre-Revolutionary and Bolshevik eras. It delineates the process through which peculiarities of technological development in Russia determined the emergence of a particular semiotic paradigm in pre-Revolutionary speculative fiction about electricity that was absorbed seamlessly into the rhetoric of the Bolshevik electrification plan of 1920. The essay pays special attention to the intertextual dependency of science fiction upon the many cultural discourses of the period, such as canonical and popular literature, mass media, advertisements, dictionaries and encyclopedias, popular philosophy, and aesthetic theory.

AB  - This essay explores the origins of science fiction as a literary genre in Latin America, specifically in Mexico. In 1775 in the colonial town of Mérida, Yucatán, the Franciscan monk Antonio de Rivas wrote a curious tale describing a voyage to the moon. While borrowing from such European sources as Johannes Kepler's Somnium, Francis Godwin's The Man in the Moone, Cyrano de Bergerac's Voyage to the Moon, and John Wilkins' The Discovery of a New World, Rivas's original treatment of the sf themes established by these better known works suggests that the Latin American intellectual community was perhaps not as disconnected from the scientific dialogues occurring in Europe during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as has been traditionally believed. The discovery of Rivas's Syzygies proves that there was at least one pioneer of early science fiction in the New World who-knowingly or not-produced a foundational text for the genre in Spanish America.

AB  - The giant 'labors' (robots) and their human pilots featured in Oshii Mamoru's 'mecha' anime 'Patlabor 2' (1993) are split figures that reflect technology's power to magnify or enhance the human while simultaneously threatening dehumanization. In 'Patlabor 2', these machines enhance perception while simultaneously creating new blind spots for the humans inside. Through his focus on vision (and its blind spots), Oshii's labors become figures that critique the related technology of mass media and what Vivian Sobchack's phenomenology of film defines as the electronic (as distinguished from cinematic) phase of visual culture. While some might contend that anime is itself part of this electronic milieu and therefore unable to mount such a critique, I argue that 'Patlabor 2' makes its point by an oscillation between the electronic and the cinematic.

KW  - sexuality
KW  - subjectivity
AB  - This paper examines two aspects of subjectivity-sexuality and singularity-that are considered fundamental to a modernist notion of the person. These aspects of subjectivity are under siege as new technologies of reproduction challenge our understanding of sexed bodies and as, simultaneously, a postmodern world-view brings forward the multiplicity of sexual subject positions and embodied hybridity that modernist thinking sought to control or dismiss. In this time of conceptual crisis regarding subjectivity and embodiment, the popular culture media of many advanced countries have produced increasing numbers of narratives about cyborgs, those embodied amalgams of the organic and the machinic. I begin by explaining why the concepts 'sexuality' and 'singularity' are so important in this context, and why Japanese popular culture is a particularly fruitful ground for exploration of cyborg subjectivities. Then I discuss two recent anime narratives-Shinseiki Evangelion (1995-96, Neon Genesis Evangelion) and KÔkaku kidôtai (1995, Ghost in the Shell)-in terms of their depictions of specific aspects of sexuality and as the nexus of contemporary fears or desires regarding subjectivity that is being negotiated through those depictions. I conclude with observations about what these narratives reveal about new, postmodern conceptions of subjectivity.

AB  - This article examines two major works in recent Japanese anime, the science-fiction series 'Neon Genesis Evangelion' (1997) and 'Serial Experiments Lain' (1999) in terms of their exploration of the human subject vis-à-vis an apocalyptic vision of technology and the real at the end of the twentieth century. While a number of popular anime have dealt with this subject since the 1970s, Evangelion and Lain are characterized by a unique approach: a concern with what happens to human identity when the machines stop-i.e., is there still subjectivity outside of technology? Evangelion answers the question in ambiguous fashion, highlighting the artifice inherent in animation itself to suggest a world of infinite possibilities, where the 'real' is simply what the imagination creates. Lain seems more pessimistic, giving its protagonist no choice but to erase herself from reality in order to save it. While they are both groundbreaking works, they are also analyzed in relation to key issues in contemporary Japanese culture, in particular its own increasingly problematic relationship with the real.

AB  - The popular genre known as 'irregular detective fiction' (henkaku tantei shôsetsu), the forerunner of Japanese science fiction, flourished in Japan during the 1920s and the 1930s. Yumeno Kyusaku's 'Dogura magura' (1935) is a representative work of this group of texts and is perceived as the culmination of the author's literary career. For Yumeno, the mode of horror was an essential ingredient for his detective fiction, and in 'Dogura magura', this horror arises from what I refer to as 'the mechanical uncanny'-the blurring of the line between human and machine resulting from the 'mechanization' of human cognition.

AB  - This article analyzes the recent films Dark City and The Thirteenth Floor (both 1998) as metaphysical detective stories in which the detective protagonist's investigation of a murder turns into a confrontation with the nature and limits of the spaces he inhabits. Using Henri Lefebvre's notion that space is a social product, I suggest that both films contribute to an understanding of the production of social space in their exploration of the recent technological 'advances' through which late capitalism has sought to extend its reign over space and of the role that virtual spaces have played within the 'ideological fantasy' that constitutes our present social (spatial) reality. I conclude that these films ultimately reveal that while 'advanced' technologies promise to produce new, liberated spaces, they in fact extend the Enlightenment/capitalist dream of a social space that can be rationally ordered and controlled.

AB  - Science fiction studies has long been an interpretive arena marked by the discontents of the overarching generic classification. Through a reading of Paul Scheerbart's Lesabéndio: An Asteroid Novel (1910), a text that operates on the edges of several genres, this article examines the historical and conceptual differences between Anglo-American and German sf scholarship and derives from recent genre theory a critical principle of explicit openness, one in which genre can become constitutive of complex and hybrid narratives. Scheerbart's text refers extensively to its discursive environment, drawing on both fictional and scientific writing-including popular, alternative, and speculative science-as well as some of the important cultural debates of its time. Parallel to its evolutionist plot, the construction of a gigantic tower as a means to finding the 'secret' of life and to advancing the species, Lesabéndio is itself a highly contrived and dynamic narrative edifice. It challenges its readers to move in and out of generic ideas, discursive formations, and, as sf, to negotiate the interactions between cognition and estrangement.

AB  - This essay offers a descriptive system intended to address film-specific phenomena in terms consonant with Darko Suvin's analysis of the forms of estrangement found in sf literature. I propose a semiotic analysis of sf film, focusing on a typology of figures of estrangement, conceived as a centripetal relation between processes of alienation and naturalization. My typology of figures is based on Louis Hjelmslev's chart illustrating the structure of the linguistic sign as adapted by the Belgian Mu Group. Since the sf genre's distinctive traits are not tied to medium-specific criteria, I argue that a structural approach can usefully characterize sf film's formal strategies without severing its rhetorical and ideological ties to other forms of sf, including literature.

AB  - Sf narrative, at its origins, makes use of two conventional narrative forms: the travel narrative and the historical narrative. Working according to its material imperative, sf has also seen scientific discoveries challenge these conventions and ultimately prove them inadequate. This is especially true in the case of the sf narrative conveying information about unknown worlds of the past or future to its reader. Some sf narratives, even in situations of extreme displacement of the narrator's audience in relation to its flesh and blood reader, continue contrafactually to rely on conventional forms and to shut their eyes to the problem. Others, however, such as those discussed in this essay, both are aware of problems created by spatiotemporal displacement and clearly seek to develop new narrative patterns to deal with them. 'Newness' in sf is usually claimed for themes and content. Theme and form are inseparable, however, and we hope to show how sf, in responding to new time-space situations generated by science, proves highly creative on the formal level as well.

KW  - female sexuality
AB  - The 'sense of wonder' traditionally attributed to sf is closely allied to the grotesque, the aesthetic of representing objects interfused and combined in an unnatural fashion. In the postmodern period, the grotesque becomes a kind of norm, since science is able to detect and synthesize an unprecedented number of things never before seen in nature. The science-fictional grotesque begins from this premise, embodying in its central repertoire of anomalies a host of monsters, cyborgs, and aliens. The sf grotesque usually involves a descent from intellectual apprehension of anomalies into relentlessly mutable and mutating bodies, and these are often coded as feminine challenges to phallocratic scientific rationality. The essay treats Stanislaw Lem's Solaris as a quintessential example of the literary sf-grotesque. In it, the grotesque core-object, the plasmic ocean, forces the Solarist scientists to reconceive their scientific rationality, while the narrative itself mutates from one form to another. The Alien films, by contrast, represent the spectacular sf-grotesque. In them, the bodies of the Aliens, the androids, and the humans undergo constantly metamorphosing embodiments and bodily relationships.

AB  - Few scholars have acknowledged the contribution of John Brunner's 'Stand on Zanzibar' (1968) to our understanding of the intersections of politics, science, society, and the environment. This essay considers Brunner's foregrounding of false representations of ecosocial conditions that are predicated on Western fantasies of unending economic growth, material abundance, and technological innovations. Set on an overcrowded Earth in 2010, the novel examines the ways in which Western socioeconomic structures inevitably shape political and technological responses to population-resource pressures. In so doing, it critiques mid-twentieth century unicausal theories of environmental problems and dramatizes the ideological blinders that prevent societies from taking corrective action. Furthermore, the novel departs from conventional narratives that emphasize individual agency and linear notions of ecological fall and recovery, focusing instead on the ways that various power structures shape and limit individual and cultural attitudes about ecosocial problems. Part fiction, part cultural theory, and part case-study for reading narratives of politics, science, and culture through and against one another, Brunner's novel suggests that taking effective social action in response to real-world ecosocial crisis demands an interdisciplinary sensibility and a commitment to dissolving capitalist fantasies about endless resources and technoscientific fixes.

AB  - This essay examines the representation of communication technologies in Stanislaw Lem's 'Solaris' and 'His Master's Voice'. Following John Johnston's definition of 'mediality' as 'the ways in which a literary text inscribes in its own language the effects produced by other media' (175), I argue that Lem employs the scenario of alien contact in these novels in order to represent the effects produced by competing media technologies. By metaphorically presenting these technologies as apparently sentient alien beings, Lem illustrates the notion that new technologies shape and determine consciousness by perceiving, recording, and storing information which was previously unrepresentable and which therefore belonged to the realm of the unconscious. 'Solaris' and 'His Master's Voice' ultimately reveal the ways in which new media technologies, such as phonography and film, influence human consciousness by prolonging the work of mourning through the preservation of voices and images of the dead.

AB  - This article attempts to map the relationships among postmodernism, science fiction, and Avant-Pop by focusing on the writings of Philip K. Dick, a purportedly postmodern sf author, and 'Amnesia Moon,' an sf novel by an Avant-Pop author, Jonathan Lethem. The Finite Subjective Realities that are depicted in 'Amnesia Moon' are read as an important element of the 'Dickian legacy,' since ontological fragmentation is such an important feature of several of Dick's works, such as The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch and Eye in the Sky. The fragmented, amnesiac, and post-catastrophic US shown in Lethem's novel through Dickian lenses is discussed in the context of Jameson's analysis of postmodernism and late capitalism (especially his study of enclosed social/architectural spaces, and his idea of cognitive mapping through 'portulans') and Dick's early insights about politics in a mass-media-saturated society.

AB  - A prolific writer of French pulp fiction at the dawn of the twentieth century, Gustave Le Rouge (1867-1938) penned an estimated 312 works in a wide variety of genres: science fiction, horror, detective fiction, spy novels, historical dramas, poetry collections, theater and screenplays, biographical studies, essays on occultism, and even cookbooks. His best-known sf works include such scientific-adventure tales as La Conspiration des milliardaires (1899), La Princesse des airs (1902), and Le Sous-marin 'Jules Verne' (1902); an imaginative two-volume space opera Le Prisonnier de la planète Mars (1908) and La Guerre des vampires (1909); and an eighteen-volume pulp epic, Le Mystérieux docteur Cornélius (1912-13). This essay attempts to familiarize English-language readers with the life and works of Gustave Le Rouge, one of the unjustly neglected pioneers of early science fiction.

AB  - The alien in sf is a trope that allows for a complex exploration of the construction of human identity and the role that otherness plays in this construction. Gwyneth Jones's Aleutian novels explore the idea of humanness through her characterization of the Aleutian aliens. Jones's aliens engage in a cultural practice of finding oneself in cultural records, which I argue can be understood as a literalization of Althusserian interpellation. In the novels, Jones plays with the double meaning of identity as both that which uniquely identifies and that with marks sameness to explore and ultimately to deconstruct the boundary between human and alien subjectivity. In conclusion, I suggest that the novels also perform their own call for a new type of human subjectivity, a subjectivity articulated against that of the liberal humanist self-contained and autonomous individual. This new subjectivity, one that is more like than unlike the aliens, is founded on connections to other living beings rather than on the need to defend a boundary of self from other.

AB  - Through a comparative analysis of the mise-en-scène of time travel in 'La Jetée' and 'Twelve Monkeys', this article explores the differences between Hollywood cinema's reliance on full visibility and presence-a rhetoric of space and light-and the film's use of a wider sensorial spectrum that destabilizes the metaphysical equation of representation with vision while putting forth a rhetoric of time and darkness. Using Heidegger's critique of metaphysics and Foucault's theory of panopticism, the article argues that 'Twelve Monkeys' reproduces the metaphorics of vision and power at work in the ontotheological tradition of Western representation. 'Twelve Monkeys' rationalizing discourse transforms the anxiety of being in time into a game of illusionist realism. Second, the film substitutes technological instrumentality for the inherently transporting capacities of the psyche. And third, while potentially dislocating, the film's time travel narrative ends up coercing temporality (and death) into a manageable, stable, and redeemable picture.

AB  - This article examines the interplay of dystopian and utopian themes in Terry Bisson's 'Pirates of the Universe,' utilizing Tom Moylan's concept of 'critical dystopia.' In the novel, Bisson maps out a number of discontinuous dystopias in a near-future US marked by rampant capitalist enterprise, out-of-control bio-technology, ecological decay, and a weak central state. These dystopias generally produce citizens with fragmented personal experiences, disinterest in social issues, and limited aspirations. Towards the end of the novel, when free and clean energy becomes available to all, Bisson explores continuing dystopian trends, articulates utopian possibilities, and emphasizes the importance of individual and collective imagination for choosing among alternatives.

AB  - 'Moon Zero Two,' made by Hammer Films in 1969, was British cinema's last space opera. A modest and rather camp production aimed at juvenile audiences, the film has the rare distinction of being a 'space western,' which updates the iconography of the classic American Western to the setting of a colonized Moon. This article considers three key aspects of the film: its use of Western motifs to underline the ideological continuity of the Old West and the New Frontier; its symptomatic interest as an example of British sf's continuing failure to match the ambition of American sf films; and its unexpectedly close thematic relationship to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Both films explore the boredom of space travel, the end of the space age, and colonization as an expression of restless male desire. The article concludes with a discussion of how British sf films of the 1960s reflected Britain's withdrawal from the space race.

AB  - The essay seeks to demonstrate that the events described in H.G. Wells's 'The Time Machine' (1895) are deliberately and rigorously historicized by being placed in a specific temporal relation to a moment in history that corresponds very closely to the date of the short novel's composition. It also claims that 'The Time Machine's' unusual narrative structure may be accounted for by the novel's hitherto largely unacknowledged topicality. Moreover, it will be suggested that its topicality has perhaps paradoxically helped to endow 'The Time Machine' with the formal and thematic durability of the classic.

AB  - Though many candidates have been proposed as models for Wells's character Doctor Moreau, none seems a particularly likely inspiration. This article argues that the scientist-philosopher Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis is by far the most strikingly similar historical precursor of the fictional Moreau. Maupertuis's family name, his surgical and breeding experiments with animals, his scientific interests and experiments, his unconventional religious and philosophical beliefs, his association with imagery from Wells's novel, and his life history combine to make him a real-life doppelgänger of Wells's fictional creation.

KW  - film
KW  - communism
AB  - I focus on representations of the 'Communist threat' in three sf B-films-Harry Horner's 'Red Planet Mars' (1952), Alfred E. Green's 'Invasion USA' (1952), and Coleman Francis's 'The Beast of Yucca Flats' (1961). Rather than using metaphors such as alien invaders or giant insects (like so many films of that era), all three directly address Communism, using it as an important element in their plots. Yet while each invokes the threat of a dangerous Soviet enemy, each also raises the possibility that internal conflicts in the United States allow that threat to flourish, holding up a mirror to US flaws and weaknesses.

AB  - This paper examines a strand of contemporary sf that draws significantly on complexity theory, in particular on new ideas about computation and information processing that bear on questions about the origins of life and intelligence, and evolution in complex adaptive systems. After a theoretical overview, it considers early examples of this influence in Bruce Sterling's first stories and novel Schismatrix. Most of the paper is then devoted to extended readings of Neal Stephenson's The Diamond Age and Linda Nagata's trilogy, The Bohr Maker, Deception Well, and Vast. Assuming but extending beyond 1980s cyberpunk fiction, both authors project future worlds profoundly transformed by nanotechnology, in which the boundary between mechanical machines and biological organisms begins to break down. Specifically, Stephenson envisions a shift from algorithmic computation (i.e. Turing machines) to a new form of biological computation in which sex provides the means of information exchange and processing. Nagata, on the other hand, deploys Artificial Life scientist Christopher Langton's theme of 'life at the edge of chaos' to re-imagine the encounter with alien modes of being and to depict new spaces of adaptation and communication.

AB  - The work of Alice Sheldon, better known as James Tiptree, Jr., is marked by conflict between a desire to overcome imperialist habits of mind and a scientist's fatalism about the limits of altering human behavior. Accordingly, much of her fiction vacillates between the two poles of postcolonialist theory and sociobiology, though with a decided leaning toward the latter, as an analysis of works from Ten Thousand Light-Years from Home (1973) to The Starry Rift (1986) shows. A focal examination of the short story 'I'll Be Waiting for You When the Swimming Pool Is Empty' (1971) demonstrates the complexity of these contradictory forces at work.

KW  - biographical approach
AB  - Defining historical, biographical, and literary contexts for Smith's writings, I analyze his oblique, elliptical style and discuss his approach to the portrayal of heroes. Smith's consistent focus, even in such non-sf as Ria (1947), Carola (1948), and Atomsk (1949), is on isolated protagonists caught in a maelstrom of contrary impulses; Martel in 'Scanners Live in Vain' is torn between body and spirit, domesticity and duty, indoctrination and independent thought. Smith's sf also assesses the 'human' cost of shifting paradigms-sudden social and scientific change-and provides a haunting critique of social control, a matter addressed covertly in his fiction and quite openly in his military intelligence textbook, Psychological Warfare (1948). Inherently speculative, science fictional, in his bold extrapolation (into a very far future) of postwar social and epistemological issues, Smith is unique among postwar writers in rejecting the violence and xenophobia of the popular tradition and also the tidy closure of Campbellian hard sf. During the 1950s and 1960s, his enigmatic stories redrew the boundaries (and re-stocked the visionary imagery) of science fiction.

AB  - Paul Selver has frequently been attacked since the late 1980s for his treachery as a translator-particularly with reference to his renditions of two of Karel Čapek's sf plays, R.U.R. (1920/21) and Bílá nemoc (1937). But Selver's translation of the latter, as Power and Glory, shows him to have been as competent as most other translators, especially of sf; and this in turn reopens the question of whether he indeed bowdlerized R.U.R. That inquiry conduces to the discovery of evidence (mostly pertaining to a typescript now in the British Library) suggesting that neither of the two different editions of R.U.R. bearing Selver's name, even when combined, represents his original work-that both 'Selver' R.U.R.s were translations by committee, as it were. Nor can he fairly be charged, as he in effect has been, with unfaithfulness to the second, revised edition of R.U.R. (1921), given that he was working either from the original published Czech version or from what one witness calls a 'manuscript.' Meanwhile, the defects of the Selver, although not certainly ascribable to him, prove instructive with regard to perceiving the meaning of Čapek's play.

KW  - film
KW  - vision
AB  - 'Blade Runner' is a film centrally concerned with vision. Prostheses of vision-the Voigt-Kampff test and the Esper machine-permit detective Rick Deckard to probe physical and even mental space, and extend his search for android 'replicants' into distant rooms and into the minds of the characters he encounters. In the Esper sequence, Deckard analyzes the photograph cherished by the replicant Leon, an analysis that turns on the presence of a convex mirror at the center of the image. This photograph echoes the mirror seen in Jan van Eyck's famous painting, The Arnolfini Portrait. Both mirrors are signs of artistic self-consciousness, pointing to the way these works sustain an extended meditation on pictorial or cinematic vision. In 'Blade Runner', the form of vision embodied by the Esper machine-which is characterized as probing, dominating, and ultimately lethal-is played off against a mode of vision tentatively but crucially present in the moment when Rachael's photograph 'comes alive' in Deckard's hands, a mode of vision that turns on imaginative empathy.

This essay identifies the dualistic elements in Dick's pre-Time Out of Joint (1959) short stories and novels, thereby continuing the line of inquiry established by the author in earlier essays on the topic. Certain methodological issues are addressed as well, including the matter of employing Dick's later writings and musings to interpret his earlier fiction, and the question of whether the idios kosmos/koinos kosmos dynamic favored by some commentators is an appropriate lens through which to interpret this fiction.

The stories employ references to Spain's long religious and colonial history, as well as references to present-day conflicts, in expressing fairly bleak visions of possible roles of religious institutions in future human society. In discussing these stories, the article draws connections with major works of English-language religious sf by James Blish, Arthur C. Clarke, Robert A. Heinlein, and Walter M. Miller, Jr.

KW  - business relations
AB  - This essay analyzes the techno-futurist vision of mid- to late-1990s business restructuring literature, arguing that the genre prominently employs sf strategies and assumptions. Three central figures emerge: the virtual organization, depicted as a revolutionary phenomenon that transcends the material constraints of the 'real' corporation; the cyborg employee, seen as the ultimate fantasy of merging the worker with the technologies of capitalism; and cybernetic culture, characterized as the manipulation of transcendent symbols for the purposes of rational management. These sf figures in contemporary business writing work together to close the gap between the conceivability and the actualization of technology-driven social transformation, as well as between the present and the future-gaps crucial to sf as a critical undertaking. In this way, business discourse, with a very different social project than sf, brings the future into the realm of the knowable, the predictable, and the controllable.

AB  - The problems of colonialism, nationalism, collective will, and their particular effects on individual rights and identity figure as central themes in the science fiction of Québec. In fact, works by Jean-Michel Wyl, Jean-Pierre April, Élisabeth Vonarburg, Jean-Louis Trudel, Denis Côté, and Jean Dion reflect the complexity of these issues within the context of the political and intellectual debate over sovereignty for Canada's majority francophone province. Through speculative works of alternate history and near-future sf, the writers of SFQ (la science-fiction québécoise) explore the problematic underlying national identity closely tied to ethnic or religious identity and the dangers of a State, federal or provincial, that forces individual conformity to that identity through mental and physical control.

AB  - In their fiction, Wells, Golding, and Auel subscribe to the approved scientific models and principles of their respective eras. Their divergent representations of the Neanderthal hominid reflect the changing nature of paleoanthropology itself: drawing upon fossil records, the study of man's origins and early development has been necessarily accretive, indefinite, and equivocal. These three writers all draw on major theories contemporary with their fiction, and the work of all three constitutes a useful and imaginative resource in our knowledge of early man.

AB  - 'Riddley Walker' is a very good mainstream novel that attempts and achieves marvelous things in language. Since it is set some two thousand years in the future, after a nuclear holocaust has wiped out civilization, it is also a science fiction novel. With respect to the language, the sf critic would not be satisfied simply with finding it an artistic success, but would want to know how systematic it is in its deviations from standard and nonstandard present-day usage in writing and speech. This article examines the constructed language ('grapholect') in which Riddley writes, using linguistic analysis to suggest that the extrapolation of language in the novel betrays many inconsistencies. Four comments by linguists follow this article, which was found among R.D. Mullen's papers following his death in 1998.

AB  - Drawing on pop-culture images of hypermasculine cyborgs and cyberpunk's 'jacked-in' console cowboys, this paper will argue, by foregrounding a fetishized technomasculinity, that these images suggest a critique of the rigid gender dichotomy of orthodox theories of fetishism in which the fetishist is always masculine and the fetishized subject is always feminine. It argues that, despite their differences, these two models of cybermasculinity suggest a technofetishization of the white, heterosexual male body in a discourse of postmodernism where the privilege of that identity is purportedly under siege, experiencing itself as relative, rather than universal, partial rather than complete. In these texts, technoparts function as fetishes by disavowing male lack and the feminization of the male subject in postmodern discourse. Thus these fetishistic fantasies can be seen, to some extent, to recuperate patriarchal authority in a posthuman context. On the other hand, these fantasized fetishized masculinities are transgressive of gender norms. Both fantasies confirm that masculinity is not natural, but is performed and constructed through technological props, and both types of masculinity-one hypermasculine and the other feminized by technological prosthetics-are in excess of traditional notions of masculinity. This paper traces both the transgressive and conservative dimensions of popular images of fetishized technomasculinities and suggests how a postmodern technofetishism might provide new possibilities for breaking down old cultural hierarchies.

AB  - Although contemporary spaceflight no longer represents the cutting edge of technological or social speculation, its rhetoric of frontier, freedom, escape, and renewal remains a useful resource for writers of politically engaged fiction. Vonda N. McIntyre reworks this old rhetoric to create anti-racist feminist narratives of space exploration. I argue that the space-future narratives of her Star Trek novelizations and her Starfarer series eschew the boys' own nostalgia that is the dominant mode of post-Heinlein hard science fiction. Opting for a strategy of respectful parody, McIntyre does not so much 'feminize' a masculinist genre as hold it to its own claims of enabling new ways of thinking about the future. Her critics are wrong to claim that her turn to popular and mainstream sf represents the disavowal of a recognizably feminist sensibility. Because it allows spaceflight narratives to imaginatively authorize social transformations, McIntyre's parodic astrofuturism is feminism under different rules of engagement. McIntyre creates a future in which the race and gender markers of subject constitution are open to resignification. In so doing she exchanges the conquest of space for an exploration that avoids reinscribing the patriarchal and racial stratifications that dominate conventional space-future speculation.

AB  - Philip K. Dick brought to science fiction a vision of reality that does not easily differentiate between objective fact and delusion. Ragle Gumm, the protagonist of Time Out of Joint (1959), straddles that unstable boundary: he finds himself living in a phony world that has been created out of his own neurosis, simultaneously perpetrator and victim of a compelling deformation of reality. An important precedent for this character and his situation is Miguel de Cervantes's Don Quixote de la Mancha (1605-1615), the first work of fiction that systematically conflates obsessive fabulation and disinterested 'truth.' This essay reads PKD through Don Quixote in order to define the sf writer's contribution to the Cervantean tradition of the modern novel.

AB  - The direct manipulation of human genes, or gene therapy, represents one of the major bioethical issues facing society as it heads into the twenty-first century. The 1997 sf film 'GATTACA' projects, from today's limited use of gene therapy, a fictional world where genetic manipulation of humans is encouraged. Essentially, the filmmakers act as bioethicists, forecasting the consequences of unrestricted human-gene therapy. The construction of 'GATTACA' as a bioethical text centers around three prominent issues: 1) genetic discrimination, 2) the cultural implications of predictive genetics, and 3) the loss of human diversity. The film is unique in that it does not fault the technology itself, but rather questions societal acceptance of an ideology that holds that humans are nothing more than the sum of their genes (genetic determinism). In the language of Bruno Latour, genetic determinism becomes a closed 'black box' once it is taken for granted and accepted as accurate and useful. In essence, 'GATTACA' is a film that tries to break open the black box that has been constructed by scientists who portray a world dominated by genes. The genetics-research community's negative reaction to 'GATTACA' indicates the stake that human geneticists have in the depiction of their science in popular culture.

AB  - Science fiction in translation began appearing in popular science magazines during the mid-1970s in Greece, but the first Greek magazine devoted exclusively to sf (Andromeda) appeared in 1977. Launching subsequent magazines and fanzines has been a risky business, often plagued by financial difficulties, irregular circulation, limited readership, and an unfavorable critical climate. Several devoted fans have tried their luck in sf publishing, but only Christos Lazos (Andromeda) and Yiorgos Bazinas (Apagorevmenos Planitis) have managed to sustain a viable circulation for their magazines. The most pressing challenges for Hellenic sf publishing (especially magazine publishing) in the coming century will be to break out of the ghetto, unite the scattered fans, appeal to a wider readership, increase sales, counter prejudice against science fiction as 'escapist trash,' and achieve respectability for the genre.

AB  - This essay examines how the robots' various confrontations with death in Karel Čapek's science fiction drama 'R.U.R.' reflect the author's explicit response to prevailing philosophical concepts of his time, especially those of Kant and Hegel. The robot Radius, for example, is a classic instance of the Hegelian master who risks death for recognition, asserting his authority over human slaves. By contrast, the robot Damon initially follows the Kantian categorical imperative in his submission to inflexible ethical law, only to apprehend and affirm his individuality at the moment of death. Damon's philosophical importance as an exemplification of Čapek's critique of the Kantian precept of duty was lost to English-language readers when the character was cut from Paul Selver's 1923 translation. Claudia Novack-Jones, in her 1989 translation of 'R.U.R.', restored the excised passages, though some of her other decisions, especially regarding the rendering of key terms, eliminated suggestive ambiguities in the original Czech. This essay, in addition to its philosophical examination of the play, also discusses linguistic issues in the various translations, restoring a sense of the verbal subtlety, as well as the ideational complexity, of Čapek's classic work.

AB  - Although often neglected by sf scholars, Albert Robida deserves recognition as a highly original and important figure in the history of science fiction. In this essay, I analyze the link between Robida's unique narrative strategies and his skill in endowing his fictional speculations with verisimilitude. Robida's vision of France in the 1950s is striking in its overall organic coherence-a sense of wholeness that is paradoxically brought about by his use of hermeneutic heterogeneity. Multiple factors enhance the impression of realism in the novels of his Twentieth Century trilogy: their historical dimension, the depth of Robida's cultural and social insights, the network of different narrative voices used, and the innovative multimedia format of these works, superbly illustrated by the author himself. Robida's artwork often supplements his narrative descriptions hypertextually, supplying peripheral information and avoiding the redundancy of conventional illustration. The distinctive characteristics of Robida's sf that set him apart from other early sf novelists are perhaps best illustrated by an analogy with an apparatus that was contemporary to him, the stereoscope. Like stereoviews, Robida's snapshots of the future are multi-dimensional, creating the illusion of both depth and substance.

AB  - Interpretations of H.G. Wells's Time Traveler have varied considerably. One school of thought views him as the quintessential Victorian hero, another as the classic scientist figure prevalent in many sf narratives. Yet another calls the Time Traveler an Everyman of the later nineteenth century. In fact, H.G. Wells had a historical figure firmly in mind when constructing the character and personality of the Time Traveler: the American inventor Thomas Edison. Using each version of The Time Machine, from the early short story 'The Chronic Argonauts' to the published novel of May 1895, this article reveals the genesis of the Time Traveler in a constant process of trial and error, as Wells sought to identify the characteristics of Thomas Edison most suitable for his own needs. This essay refers to the life and achievements of Thomas Edison in order to illuminate successive changes in the various versions of The Time Machine. The heterogeneity of these narratives-especially their protagonists' respective character traits-speaks to paradoxical qualities in Edison himself, both as a man and as a popular myth.

AB  - Ray Cummings (1897-1957), American pulp sf writer once dubbed the 'American H.G. Wells,' can probably be ranked as the third most popular sf author of the 1920s and 30s, behind Edgar Rice Burroughs and Abraham Merritt. His 1919 masterpiece 'The Girl in the Golden Atom' was arguably one of the most well-known sf novelettes published in the Munsey magazines, and many of his sf works were reprinted as paperback books during the 1950s and 60s. Two of Cummings' magazine stories, however, were never reprinted as books: 'The Fire People' (1922) and 'Around the Universe' (1923). This article is both a general introduction to the early science fiction of Ray Cummings and a discussion of these two largely forgotten sf narratives.

AB  - In November 1919, four months after his sixteenth birthday, John [Wyndham Parkes Lucas] Beynon Harris published the first part of a story entitled 'Vivisection' in the second issue of The Bee, a short-lived journal 'Produced by Members of Bedales School.' The following year, the complete eight issues of The Bee were published as a single volume by Morland Press, London. 'Vivisection,' which is clearly inspired by H.G. Wells's The Island of Doctor Moreau, would seem to be both Harris's and, effectively, 'John Wyndham's' first publication. It was as a science fiction writer in the Wellsian mode that John Wyndham received international acclaim and made a significant impact on the development of British and world sf. His schoolboy publication 'Vivisection'-here reproduced for the first time-is important because it points directly to the successful second phase of Harris's career, a phase arrived at (five years after World War II) following a pre- and post-war 'American' phase (which can now be understood as an instructive detour) as 'John Beynon [Harris],' the sole British writer during the 1930s to establish a reputation in such American sf pulp magazines as Wonder Stories.

AB  - This is my version of the story of the beginnings of modern academic work on sf from the 1930s until 1980. This work in the academy began with isolated bibliographic efforts and ended with full-blown critical work. A major turning point in the work came with a 1958 seminar at the MLA and the year following, when Extrapolation was founded as the fledgling academic journal and when Kingsley Amis spoke on sf. Another key turning point came with the abundance of criticism in the 1970s. A main element in the story, however, is the suggested link here between the early academics and some of the escapist, 'idealist,' even fascist values in some sf.

AB  - This overview of sf criticism from 1980 to 1999 is divided into three sections: 1) 'Mapping the Field,' which recommends some histories, genre studies, media sf studies, and reference guides; 2) 'Sf Writers on Sf,' which calls attention to a number of nonfiction and critical works by sf authors, as well as to some author interviews; 3) and 'When It Changed,' which discusses a variety of both feminist and postmodern studies of sf. While this overview does not claim to be a complete listing of every significant study which has appeared in the past twenty years, it does aim to develop the sense of a scholarly field in the middle of an unprecedented expansion, and to indicate some of the ways in which sf, itself an arena of cultural production undergoing various unexpected metamorphoses, is currently being appropriated by other scholarly disciplines for whom it provides a source of important cultural material. Sf studies itself has branched out into many new directions, been influenced by many complex political and theoretical perspectives, and achieved some legitimacy within academia, due in part to the postmodern turn away from high culture/popular culture distinctions. A review of the critical work published over the last twenty years suggests that sf studies is flourishing as never before, even as efforts to define what sf is/is becoming are being challenged as never before.

AB  - The extensive commentaries produced by members of the science fiction community, called here the popular tradition of science fiction criticism, were launched by the editorial pronouncements and theories of Hugo Gernsback, beginning in 1926 with the first issue of Amazing Stories. In the 1930s, new editorial voices added little to Gernsback's ideas, though writers for the growing numbers of amateur magazines, called fanzines, were offering some distinctive contributions. In the 1940s, editor John W. Campbell, Jr. significantly expanded and deepened Gernsback's theories to articulate a satisfying, mature vision of science fiction. In the decades that followed, many important new commentators emerged: new magazine editors, book reviewers, anthologists, and editors and authors of books about science fiction. In the 1960s, Michael Moorcock and Harlan Ellison led a major effort to reform the genre, the New Wave movement. Though academic critics often outshone their untrained counterparts in examinations of particular works, the thoroughness, sense of focus, and dedication of the popular commentaries ensured that they would remain valuable resources for science fiction scholars, then and now.

AB  - From Johannes Kepler's 1634 notes on his Somnium to essays by and on H.G. Wells in the early twentieth century, there have been many critical explorations of the literature we now call science fiction. The commentaries of these (often forgotten) early critics are of value principally because they first expressed many-if not most-of those concerns that would later become central to the sf criticism of the twentieth century: the impact of science and technology on human values, the logistics of space travel, the shifting boundaries between the real and the imagined, the portrayal of the alien 'other,' and the possible futures of our world. Further, they consistently raised key questions about the defining features of the genre itself as it continued to evolve: its preferred themes, its social purpose, its scientific and moral didacticism, its perceived level of verisimilitude, and its place in the Western literary canon. Finally, as the new millennium dawns, it seems appropriate that we look to our distant past to rediscover what these early commentators had to say about the many science fictional works of their times: doing so serves to deepen our understanding of the historical continuity of the ongoing sf debate and to make us aware of both how much and how little has changed over the centuries.

AB  - 'Man in the High Castle' is not a systematic theological tractate on the order of VALIS. It does, however, encompass significant amounts of basic Taoist and Christian theology. On the one hand, none of Dick's other novels comes close to containing the number of explicit references in MHC to Taoism, and the importance of these to the understanding of the novel has not been overlooked. On the other hand, the role of Christian theology in MHC has been almost completely ignored, and especially the vital part played by Dick's conflated comprehension of gnostic Christian dualism and fundamental Pauline theology. In MHC, Dick employs the standard terminology and categories of dualistic cosmologies to frame the redemptive journeys undertaken by each of the novel's five major characters-Robert Childan, Frank Frink, Nobosuke Tagomi, Rudolf Wegener, and Juliana Frink. These journeys towards personal (and sometimes corporate) salvation sit at the heart of MHC, and therefore to grasp the theological and philosophic content in which they are expressed is to apprehend better the meaning of the novel itself. MHC thus represents an important stage in an aspect of Dick's philosophy that has its origins no later than Time Out of Joint (1959) and that continues, in different manifestations, to its full flowering in the VALIS trilogy of the early 1980s.

AB  - This essay discusses sf by Dan Simmons and Iain M. Banks as a contemporary version of galactic-empire fiction. This fiction shares a set of characteristics: ambitious, multifarious inclusiveness; uninhibited hedonism; complicated relations with textuality and intertextuality; a complicated depiction of space as noncoherent, subject to no uniform rules; decentered subjects, but, on the other hand, a return of depth. It is suggested that this fiction expresses the operations of a postmodern imaginary on the materials of traditional galactic-empire sf; this imaginary operates mainly by excess, overload, and exacerbation. A postmodernizing of the galactic-empire novel ends up expressing the anxieties of the postmodern condition.

AB  - Despite the fact that Mamoru Oshii's 'Ghost in the Shell' seems to espouse a political agenda that is in keeping with feminist theorizations of the cyborg, it covertly reworks this agenda into an endorsement of conventional configurations of sexual difference. The film gratifies desires for a strong, multiply-positioned female protagonist who uses technology as a means of empowerment, while simultaneously containing her subversive potential by re-narrating it within an older and better known paradigm: the dominance of masculine mind and spirit over the feminine materiality of the body. The film thus functions as an instrument of ideological containment that seems to be subversive on its 'surface' while contextualizing that subversion within traditional narratives of sexual difference.

AB  - This essay aims to construct strategic intersections between queer theory and feminist theory, in order to suggest how queer theory's attention to issues of gender and sexuality can enrich feminist critical reading. Through detailed readings of C.L. Moore's 'No Woman Born,' James Tiptree Jr.'s 'The Girl Who Was Plugged In,' and Joanna Russ's 'The Mystery of the Young Gentleman,' I make use of some of the powerful insights of queer theory, such as its perspectives on gender performativity, in order to identify some of the complex ways in which sf, especially feminist sf, has ironized and problematized conventional concepts of gender and sexuality almost since its inception. Although science fiction tends to be an overwhelmingly straight imaginative discourse, queer theoretical perspectives, such as those developed by Judith Butler, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Sue-Ellen Case, and Monique Wittig, allow us to broaden our appreciation of the ways in which some sf has challenged the technologies of compulsory heterosexuality. These perspectives also suggest how queering feminist critical reading might help us to think against the grain of a naturalized heteronormativity. I aim to make a case in this essay for the utopian potential of queer as theory, strategy, and imaginative construction; it is my contention that such potential has already been outlined in a broad range of sf narratives by feminist and queer writers.

AB  - This article aims both to code and to decode, through the lens of queer theory, some of the 'alien cryptographies' of science fiction. The figure of the alien, not surprisingly, is at the center of this (re)reading, which includes detailed analyses of two very different treatments of the alien/queer as the figure who moves invisibly through the territories of heteronormativity: John W. Campbell's 'Who Goes There?' (1938) and Tom Reamy's 'Under the Hollywood Sign' (1975). The purpose of this essay is to delineate some of the complexities of queer as both political positioning and intellectual perspective; it suggests the wide variety of ways in which both readers and texts may be queered and it is committed to the notion of a postmodern and anti-essentialist engagement with identity politics. Science fiction's propensity for rewriting the 'common sense' narrative worlds of realism, its location on the margins of mainstream literature, and its techniques of cognitive estrangement are attributes which make of it a potentially powerful method of exploration in our ongoing attempts to envision worlds in which queer and alien no longer function as synonymous terms.

AB  - In a series of science-fiction novels describing future warfare-Robert Heinlein's 'Starship Troopers' (1959), Joe Haldeman's 'The Forever War' (1972), and Orson Scott Card's 'Ender's Game' (1985)-the technologically augmented body serves as a site of anxiety. Cultural and social fears about what it means specifically to be male or generally to be human are expressed and negotiated here. These fears are triggered by the complex realization that the promise of prosthetics to heal, integrate, and strengthen the body is accompanied by the further dissolution of the body and the radical challenge to human agency and autonomy. In a culture characterized by the discourse of the surgical strike and the prosthetic body, resolving these ambiguities and contradictions becomes the task not only for each author in the individual texts, but for readers as they determine their own subjectivity in relation to high-tech culture.

AB  - The 'Historical Notes' appearing at the end of Margaret Atwood's 'The Handmaid's Tale' have been the subject of repeated critical scrutiny. Commentaries have suggested that the world of 2195 is far from an eutopian alternative to the dystopia of Gilead; indeed, commentators consistently note the sexism of Pieixoto and suggest that the conditions that led to the founding of Gilead in the first place still exist in the world of 2195. The world of 2195 is one in which women once again assume positions of authority and in which Native North American peoples are evidently part of the dominant culture. It might appear, therefore, an eutopian alternative to Gilead, and perhaps even to the world of today, if we can accept at face value that the sexist and racist assumptions prevalent in Gilead (and today) have been eradicated; but we cannot. Instead, we are forced by the inconsistencies and disjunctions created by Pieixoto's deeply flawed analysis of Offred's account to question the documentary method itself as a valid arbiter of truth.

AB  - The publication of William Gibson's 'Idoru' allows us to read the earlier 'Virtual Light' as its intertextual precursor; it becomes possible to redress the critical silence previously surrounding both texts. This paper argues that the decline of cyberpunk and cyberspace into marketing device and hyperreality, required Gibson's abandonment of digital tectonics for analog information structures-a device through which to explore the retrofuturistic 'posthuman.' By refiguring the Bridge community of 'Virtual Light' as an organic hive-like entity, Gibson transposes metaphor into architextural meta-form, refurbishing the recurrent theme in his work of the effect of place, space and architecture on 'posthuman' form and ontology. This new neo-tribal heterotopian space lays the foundation for the mediation of the posthuman coded as information topology in 'Idoru'. The disruption of the subject/object dichotomy in 'Virtual Light' prefigures the boundary transgressions of flesh, data, and biologic nanotechnology in 'Idoru', enabling the inversion of inner and outer through body, landscape, and cyborgian architexture. In the latter novel, the idoru Rei inverts the sf trope of transcendence-she escapes the binary digital confines of data for rhizomatic analog complexity-achieving a metaphorical symbiotic union with the corporeality of the rock star Rez. The iconic mapping of their converging data creates an unstable assemblage, an involution where differences are replaced by diffractions. For Gibson, then, the posthuman becomes an irruption within the human. This leads to the central conclusion of this paper: that the posthuman should be reconceived as the under erasure.

AB  - Frank Herbert's DUNE series mirrors its explicit ecological theme through its dynamical-systems plot structure, which echoes the fractal geometry image's definitive quality of self-similarity across the same scale. It does so, among other ways, through the incorporation of the Monomyth as a principal structuring device in each of its six novels. This repetition of the Monomyth is but one instance of the series' fractal iteration of numerous ancillary parallel plot structures and themes, but is of unique importance because it subsumes within it the reiteration in each of these six novels of the many interrelated elements that comprise the Monomyth, as defined by Joseph Campbell in The Hero With a Thousand Faces. This article analyzes the recurrence of this archetypal plot structure in each volume of the DUNE series, giving special attention to the specific pattern of variations and inversions introduced by Herbert, to further demonstrate the series' pervasive fractal structure. Herbert's aesthetic achievement in mirroring the DUNE series' ecological theme in its recurring fractal structure through this recycling of the Monomyth is wonderfully compounded, not only in that mirroring is itself the essential characteristic of any fractal structure, but also in that the Monomyth, as the single consciously-controlled pattern most widely exhibited in the world's folk tales, myths, and religious fables, is already intrinsically fractal by definition.

AB  - Cyrano de Bergerac (1619-1655) wrote imaginary voyages to the Moon and to the Sun, both often titled together L'Autre Monde. These fantastic voyages, filled with extremely diverse events and beings of various kinds, both human and non-human, enable the author to imagine non-traditional forms of society, physics, travel, language, sensory perception, and philosophy. Generally, Cyrano wishes to refute the traditional Christian, geocentric, and Aristotelian views of the universe, and in order to do so, he bases himself in two alternative sciences, or visions of the world, available to him in his day, the atomistic and the alchemical visions. Critics have generally tended to view Cyrano as either materialist or hermetic, but I consider him to be interested in both these systems of knowledge. The body is the particular entity where these two systems of knowledge meet and interact, for it is Cyrano's view that the body is part of knowing-i.e., for him knowledge may be a matter of the spirit, but it is always embodied. Cyrano wants to imagine new ways of thinking about humanity and the universe: to this end, he uses reversals, an easy way to jolt and amuse the reader, but he also goes far beyond reversals to imagine, with great freedom, multiple possibilities for understanding the body, the mind, philosophy, and the universe.

AB  - In this essay I argue that Octavia Butler's work provides fine examples of what Tom Moylan has called the 'critical dystopia,' a narrative which points to the socio-historic causes of the dystopian elements of our culture rather than one which merely reveals symptoms. Butler works through the dystopian elements of the culture and then seeks to create new myths for the postmodern age. She does not offer a full-blown utopian 'blueprint' in her work, but rather a post-apocalyptic hoping informed by the lessons of the past. In both the Xenogenesis trilogy and Parable of the Sower, Butler stares into the abyss of the dystopian future and reinvents the desire for a better world. In doing so, she places herself firmly within a rich tradition of feminist utopian writing while also speaking to some of the same issues as Marxist critic Fredric Jameson and postmodern feminist thinkers such as Donna Haraway and Gloria Anzaldùa.

AB  - This essay examines Darwinian implications of the atomic bomb as represented in three classic 1950s sf films. The Darwinian opposition between evolution and devolution finds shape in postwar American society as it structures many of the key issues of the time, including anxiety surrounding atomic power, fear of Soviet communism, and fear of McCarthyism. The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms and Them! focus on the dehumanization brought about by forces which threaten to devolve American society. The Incredible Shrinking Man explores Darwinian ideas from another angle, arguing that physical and social devolution resulting from the bomb may in fact provide an opportunity for mental evolution. The gender implications of this evolution/devolution are also addressed.

KW  - film
AB  - Stanley Kubrick might be described as a metageneric filmmaker, since his major works tend to take apart and to reconstruct the inherited conventions of the pertinent filmic genre (horror in The Shining, historical romance in Barry Lyndon, and so forth). Kubrick's most intense and complex metageneric analysis is of science fiction in 2001. A historical and theoretical consideration of the science-fiction film reveals that it is structured on a central and virtually disabling contradiction: between the cognitive and critical structure of science fiction as a literary mode, on the one hand, and, on the other, the general association of science-fiction cinema with the dominance of special effects, which tend to induce an anti-critical intellectual banality. Nearly alone in science-fiction cinema, 2001 manages to short-circuit this contradiction by dialectically thematizing the whole matter of intellectual banality and thus, so to speak, solving the problem by raising it to the second power. 2001 is the first and last great masterpiece of science-fiction film.

AB  - Science-fiction writing in Chile seemingly burst onto the literary scene from nowhere with the publication of Hugo Corea's Los altísimos in 1959. As this study shows, however, a number of Chilean writers, working largely in obscurity, had laid the groundwork for a body of national sf literature over the course of the previous decades. Most of these texts fall into one of three categories: novels of social criticism; space adventure tales; and lost world romances based on regional history and mythology. Although they borrow from the sf literary traditions being developed in Europe and the US, many of these works are explicitly set in Chile and feature Chilean characters, events, and national concerns. Some of the earlier works celebrate the potential inherent in change, while others are much more distrustful of 'progress' and are pessimistic about technological solutions to social problems. The texts tend to de-emphasize scientific explanation and privilege the wondrous over the plausible-a common characteristic of Latin American sf, one which both utilizes and promotes the sense of mysterious reality fostered by the Latin American fantastic, and later, by magical realism.

KW  - 'Pallinghurst Barrow'
AB  - Both in The Time Machine and the later work, The Croquet Player, H.G. Wells owed a significant debt, previously untraced, to a ghost story by Grant Allen, 'Pallinghurst Barrow.' The attribution is solid, on internal and external grounds that apply to both books, and it is even clear that Wells expected his readers of 1895 to see his debt and to understand the nature of it. This debt is thematic, structural, and generic. Allen's theme is the Darwinian arrow of progress, inverted, looking back to savage ages past. He structures this theme by means of confronting a contemporary Englishman with inhabitants of the late Stone Age in Britain and then confronting him again with a largely sceptical audience for his tale. The genre is the ghost story, which provides the needed 'vehicle' for the time-swap. In The Time Machine the same elements are shifted to the future. The degenerative arrow points forward rather than back; the Englishman encounters the savagery of the Eloi and Morlocks and returns to a sceptical audience; and his 'vehicle' is his machine, the science-fictional 'novum' that displaces the old creaky mechanisms of the ghost story. As to The Croquet Player, it too is a twice-told tale; its sceptical narrator calls it 'a sort of ghost story'; and it concerns 'Cainsmarsh,' a contemporary fenland that harbors the evil of the palaeolithic and even earlier ages. Thus, through 'Pallinghurst Barrow,' one gets a new look at both of Wells's works.

AB  - Jules Verne's original 'Voyages Extraordinaires' contained over four thousand illustrations-an average of 60+ per novel in the popular Hetzel red and gold 'luxury' French editions. These Victorian-looking wood-cut plates and maps constituted an integral part of Verne's early sf oeuvre and, intercalated into the text at intervals of every 6-8 pages, they provided a powerful and omnipresent visual support structure to the text's fictional narrative, its embedded pedagogical lessons, and its 'arm-chair voyage' exoticism. The world-wide popularity of Verne's romans scientifiques was no doubt at least partly attributable to the presence of these illustrations in his works. Thus, given the hermeneutic and historical importance of the illustrations in Verne's oeuvre, it is somewhat surprising that, to date, they and the individuals who created them have been virtually ignored in both sf and Vernian criticism. This article discusses the many varieties and functions of the illustrations in Verne's 'Voyages Extraordinaires', the talented artists and engravers who produced them, their collaborative working relationship with Verne and the editor Hetzel, and the technological evolution of this craft itself from Verne's earliest works in the 1860s to his final post-humous novel published in 1919.

AB  - The Machine Age brought enormous changes which were freighted with a great deal of cultural anxiety, due to a lingering technophilia and a growing sense of the sort of challenge we faced in a world dominated by the machine. One strategy the arts employed for addressing this challenge was what Dickran Tashiian terms 'monumentalization,' that is, the tendency to depict machinery through extreme close-up views or with accentuated dimensions. In this way we could suggest the size and power of our technology, while also drawing it out of its normal context to better examine and assess its implications. British science fiction films of the 1930s, particularly works like The Tunnel (1935) and 'Things to Come' (1936), draw heavily on this approach in depicting their near-futures our technology might make possible. What results, though, is less an embrace of the technological spirit than an emphasis on the distance we still felt from the technology itself: a wariness of its supposed powers and potentials. In the monumental style of 'Things to Come' especially, then, we can see traces of how difficult the cultural construction of the technological was proving to be in this period.

KW  - Darwinism
AB  - The superman story has long been a staple of science fiction, combining wish-fulfillment fantasy with the scientific rationale of Darwinian evolution. Under the prodding of John W. Campbell, Jr., nearly every writer of the Golden Age produced at least one such story, and some, like A.E. Van Vogt, wrote little else. In a story that critiques the superman scenario, Philip K. Dick revealed the gender assumptions underlying both the literary and the scientific traditions. Dick's 'The Golden Man' (1954) takes off on themes developed in Van Vogt's Slan (1940), Norvell Page's 'But Without Horns' (1940) and other Campbell-era fiction, showing that the superhuman characters therein say more about gender roles than about evolutionary advancement. In doing so, Dick also echoed the earlier work of Stanley Weinbaum, whose pre-Campbell The New Adam (1939) depicts a superman whose masculine traits are precisely his points of weakness.

AB  - Political themes have been a major focus of Canadian fantastic literature since its beginnings in the nineteenth century. One of the issues both English and French authors have dealt with is the possibility of Québec separation; how might the dissolution of Confederation take place, and what would be the consequences? French and English writers exhibit marked differences in their approach, with English authors seeing the possibility in more negative and pessimistic terms. Yet both linguistic groups are equally motivated by fear-of what would happen if Québec did separate in the case of the English, and what would happen if it did not in the case of the French. Also, a number of common tropes can be discerned in the fiction of both groups about this theme.

AB  - The cultural phenomenon of alien abduction narratives has been met with silence or contempt by most of the academic community. This is an understandable response, given the mix of credulity, pseudo-scientific legitimation and uncontrolled paranoia surrounding the discourse of abduction. This essay argues that however outlandish the claims of UFOlogists and abduction researchers, the phenomenon is worthy of study for its evidence of an increasing 'science-fictionalisation' of certain aspects of contemporary American culture. Four vectors are identified as being responsible for the emergence of abduction stories: shifts in conceptions of memory and subjectivity in American psychiatry (particularly claims surrounding 'recovered memory' and hypnotic regression); increasing fears around the intrusiveness of a technologically saturated world, and subsequent extension of the discourse of the American technological sub-lime; the emergence of a distinctive counter-cultural New Ageism, which articulates the visitation of UFOs in larger discourses of spiritual evolution; an intensification of post-war American conspiracy theory and suspicions of 'big government.' Ending with a reading of the way in which these elements are synthesized by The X-Files, the essay concludes by suggesting that abduction narratives are the science fictionalised products of a felt intermittency of subjectivity in contemporary America.

KW  - 'The Conquest of Gola'
AB  - Leslie F. Stone is a little-known woman writer from the early days of science fiction. In the story examined here, 'The Conquest of Gola,' she posits a matriarchal planet in which men are kept by women as houseboys and playthings. This planet is invaded by men from another planet who want to colonize it for their own purposes. The women of Gola don't take these invaders seriously. A war is fought, in which the women use superior technology and thought-forms to defend themselves and to battle the men. In this reversal, Stone spoofs not only sex roles, but also imperialism and colonialism. Her story predicts certain inventions such as laser beams, and demonstrates the strong influence of H.G. Wells. Her work seems to reflect intellectual currents of the times, including the popularity of psychoanalysis and the call for more egalitarian inclusion of women in the cultural arena.

KW  - American literature
AB  - The paradigmatic view of cyberpunk, both inside and outside sf literary-critical circles, is drawn from Larry McCaffery's Storming the Reality Studio, which charts an ostensible 'interaction' between sf proper and avant-garde mainstream fiction which is signalled as a particular feature of cyberpunk and, moreover, described as an inevitable product of the emergence of late capitalist culture. This paper explores the implications of what Bruce Sterling conceptualizes as 'slipstream' fiction by way of an interpretive analysis of Kathy Acker's plagiarism in Empire of the Senseless of William Gibson's 'Neuromancer'. Acker's 'reading' of Gibson reveals the very real differences between her own avant-garde and experimental metafiction, and what turns out to be the fundamentally stable and realist text that Gibson offers us. The argument that 'Neuromancer', or sf in general, is losing its generic specificity is itself an interesting phenomenon that, as Roger Luckhurst has already suggested in SFS, has to do with the problem of legitimation that haunts sf criticism, and that, if 'solved,' will result in the destruction of the powerful and intrinsically valuable generic wall that defines sf.

AB  - Culminating in the recent publication of 3001, Arthur C. Clarke's Odyssey series configures a masculinity in evolution towards disembodiment, or pure mind. Although working within the tradition of H.G. Wells, Clarke also draws heavily, I argue, from the genre-Western's 'basic situation' as established in turn-of-the-century collaborations between Owen Wister and Frederic Remington, specifically The Virginian and John Ermine (1902). In reaction to nineteenth-century crises of American manhood, Wister and Remington founded not only a hardbody masculinity in their fiction and illustrations, but at the same time installed the generic formula which drove Western fiction until the war in Vietnam. Along these lines, Western novelist Wallace Stegner's Angle of Repose (1971) may have represented a cultural autopsy for the discredited cowboy hardbody, but only after Clarke and Kubrick's covert appropriation of the genre Western in 2001 had already hosted a rejuvenation or rebirth of that dying masculinity in the disembodied Star-Child. Such a transference and recuperation of cowboy masculinity reveals the cooperation of the genres in service of the same equilibrium: white heterosexual manhood. In his 1977 novel Fork River Space Project, however, novelist Wright Morris mounts an explicit rejection of cowboy masculinity's transformation in 2001, further articulating the nature of such a masculinity's impasse-an impasse that is unsuccessfully engaged in the latter three Odyssey novels. Owen Wister's original flight from neurasthenia almost a hundred years ago thus assembles a hardbody masculinity which, in Clarke's 2001, snaps inside-out on the generic boundary between the Western and sf, resulting in a psychasthenia or disembodied masculinity whose claim to a transcendence of history only accelerates the progress of its self-engendered cultural irrelevance.

KW  - American literature
AB  - As staged in Dick's novel, the android inaugurates a crisis of subjectivity. What does it mean to be human in an era wherein human conjoins with machine, biology with technology, nature with manufacture?-Clearly, it is a question confronted by Rick Deckard, protagonist bounty hunter of the twenty-first-century cyborg. Rick's ability to empathize with other creatures-the defining aspect of humanity, according to the juridical system that employs him-leads him to an ethical conundrum: he begins to empathize with the android, the very creature he has been consigned to exterminate. Far from reassuring him of his existential privilege as human, then, Rick's empathy underscores the speciousness of that hierarchy. It throws into relief the contrived ontological imbalance between self and other, human and android. My paper explores this failure of empathy to secure Rick's prerogative of human selfhood. Extrapolating from ideas expressed in Francisco J. Varela, Evan Thompson, and Eleanor Rosch's The Embodied Mind, I argue that Rick's new respect for android lives stems not from the ethic of empathy promulgated in the narrative's Mercerist theology, but from another, more authentic form of empathy, one that dramatically challenges traditional notions of existence. This version of empathy (or 'compassion,' as The Embodied Mind names it) is sensed by one who conceives his self as, in fact, a non-self-as a being that amounts to no more than a sequence of embodied experiences. Such a being does not (as Rick has been told to do) insulate himself from external depreciations, but rather perceives himself in an existential continuity with the other that materially shares his world. It is this eventual understanding that provokes Rick's empathy for the android, one of the many technologies with which he resides in a state of mutual determination. Indeed, human subjectivity, as the novel posits it, has always already been infringed upon by these technologies-the television and the empathy box most notably. This fact is hyperbolized in the human community's dependency upon them, a dependency that I explicate in terms of Scott Bukatman's discussion of 'image addiction.' In effect, Rick's experience of this broad technological landscape awakens him to his basic planetary contingency-to the cooperative materialization of human and machine in the posthuman collective.

AB  - The sf works of French author Serge Brussolo have been, since the early 1980s, hugely popular in France. Although still untranslated into English, Brussolo's 50+ sf novels and anthologies present a unique approach to the genre. By infusing into classical sf topoi wildly hallucinatory imagery and dreamscape encounters of all sorts, Brussolo offers the reader an alternative experience to the traditional sf novum. Much like J.G. Ballard, Brussolo uses the protocols of sf as an effective jumping-off-point for a sometimes Kafkaesque exploration of the human subconscious. Recalling the 'convulsive beauty' esthetics of André Breton, Brussolo's works exemplify the palpable link between surrealism and science fiction-a kinship which remains largely unexplored in modern sf scholarship.

KW  - war
AB  - The Tale of the War-to-come-from Kubrick's Dr Strangelove to The Invasion of England in 1803-is immediately recognizable as the most self-contained area of future fiction, since the basic propositions of these projected accounts of wars still-to-come derive from the political or technological possibilities of their day. They first began to affect the thinking of nations after the extraordinary success of Chesney's Battle of Dorking in 1871. That warning to the British people was an immediate reaction to the new kind of warfare revealed in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870; and it proved to be an ideal model for the many tales of 'the next great war' that became a familiar means of anticipating technological advances in warfare and of presenting arguments for bigger fleets and greater armies. From 1871 to 1914, as the major European powers advanced towards a conflict all expected, a continuous stream of these anticipations gave their readers highly selective accounts of salutary defeats or well-deserved victories in 'the next great war' that would be fought between one or another of the international groupings of that time. With the emergence of the mass press in the 1890s, this future-war fiction became a favored means of warning a nation of the urgent need for more troops or more ships. In a most ironic way, however, these anticipations of wars-to-come were grounded in the assumption that, when the Great War began in earnest, it would be an old-style affair of decisive fleet actions and one-day infantry engagements.

AB  - C.L. Moore's 'Shambleau,' too often read as a symptom of Moore's supposed self-alienation or self-loathing, is here read alongside later origin-narratives based on 'Shambleau' by Moore herself and Lester del Rey. Employing Donna Haraway's critical framework of the cyborg, which links issues of technology, gender, subjectivity, and the process of retelling origin stories, I suggest that 'Shambleau' can be read less dismissively as a story which exposes the dominant discourses' reliance upon a narrative of the Fall of language which defines the feminine as both marginal and subject to masculine control. Central to this reading are the intersections of technology and gender which resonate between Moore's story and Moore's own narration of her story's origins and which suggest that the re-narration of origin stories is a process central to feminist sf.

AB  - Since the 1960s Samuel Delany's work has frequently been at the speculative edge of 'soft' science, feminism, and post-humanist thought. Its equally ongoing concern with mythology moves from '60s resistance of white patriarchal heterosexual myths to their denial, deconstruction, and, with Dhalgren, demolition of myths and their generating system together. In the Nevèr on cycle postmodern theory informs the construction of a new (form of) mythology. Derridean theory supplies the 'Symbolic Order' of the cycle's blurred margins and centerless structure, while Foucault's use of S/M experience is paralleled in the series' 'homoerotic Imaginary.' Its eroticizing and mythicizing fantasies transgress generic and cultural boundaries in a manner characteristic of Delany's earlier sf, but here they also demonstrate the crucial interventions of postmodern theory in a work about Foucauldian 'limit-experiences' that becomes a 'limit-experience' in itself.

It draws on contemporary cultural criticism to burlesque the development of technology in a number of important aspects: the use of supercomputers to wage an atomic war particularly and also to depict a mass movement dedicated to the removal of human aggression by amputating limbs. The latter movement explains the black joke of the novel's title and emerges as an exercise in self-mystification since the new prosthetic limbs turn out to be vastly more powerful than their originals. Like Vonnegut in Player Piano, Wolfe shows cybernetics to involve a dangerous series of substitutions for the human, dangerous because they obscure the divided and ambivalent nature of humanity. In order to bring out such ambivalence Wolfe implicates his surgeon-protagonist Dr. Martine in the novel's power structures and also uses a series of puns and other word play to alert the reader to a duplicity not just in Cold War political statements but in expressions of human purpose more generally. Limbo anticipates later fiction by Pynchon and the cyberpunk group in its ironic examination of humanity's technological constructs.

AB  - Fan writer Jean Lorrah has published a number of novels based on the series, 'Star Trek' and 'Star Trek: The Next Generation'. This article explores several of Lorrah's novels, tracing within them both conservative and non-mainstream voices and discourses. Alongside patriarchal representations of gender relationships, Lorrah offers an exploration of interpersonal intimacy which is fundamentally subversive of patriarchal strategies. Her female characters are both feminine and autonomous, victimized but not victims. And in her representation of Vulcan society Lorrah articulates values which are alien indeed to bourgeois society: solidarity, cohesion, loyalty, kinship. These novels do not have the shock value of the sexually-explicit 'slash' writings, and yet they voice values and attitudes which may be equally challenging to mainstream opinion.

AB  - This discussion examines 'Star Trek: The Next Generation's' recurring interest in heterosexual desire and its frustration. In several key episodes of the series, heterosexuality is simultaneously reinscribed as the essential locus of desire, and disrupted by repeated assertions of the inescapable differences between men and women. The essay offers a lengthy discussion of two key episodes, 'The Perfect Mate,' and 'In Theory,' in terms of their constructions of the ideal romantic Other, and their conclusions about the ultimate inaccessibility of that ideal. It situates this disruption of desire against the backdrop of both current popular culture discourse about heterosexual romance, and the postfeminist backlash against changing gender roles.

AB  - This essay uncovers and critiques the relationship between the meaning of race and the liberal-humanist project in 'Star Trek'. While there are no doubt many factors informing this relationship, it concentrates on the activities of institutions and decision-makers responsible for the making of the series. This includes NBC, the network on which the series aired, Gene Roddenberry, the creator and executive producer, as well as various writers, directors, and actors. These 'authors' were consciously and thus intentionally involved in a liberal-humanist project very much mindful of such 1960s experiences as the civil rights movement, the anti-war movement, and the Cold War. Contrary to what is commonly said about this sf series, the essay argues that 'Star Trek's' liberal-humanist project is exceedingly inconsistent and at times disturbingly contradictory: it often participates in and facilitates racist practice in attempting to imagine what Gene Roddenberry called 'infinite diversity in infinite combinations.'

AB  - 'Write Ch. [3 cancelled]2 1/2.' This puzzling entry in Mary Shelley's journal for 27 October 1816' (the birth date of sf if Frankenstein is indeed the first true example of the genre) is explained as referring to a Last Draft insert headed 'Chapt. 2' which describes the first stage of Frankenstein's supposed 'conversion' from the ancient philosophers to modern science. This insert, originally intended either as an entire chapter preceding what became Chapter II of Volume I of the 1818 Frankenstein or as the opening section of that chapter, was subsequently shifted back into the preceding chapter. Then, most probably at the Fair Copy stage, it was revised and divided into two portions which replace material in the Last Draft cancelled immediately before and immediately after Frankenstein's description of his witnessing an oak destroyed by lightning. Since the issue of Frankenstein's 'conversion' determines the generic identification of the novel as sf (perhaps the first such), and bears on the case for viewing sf generally as a mixed material/metaphysical genre, a detailed analysis of the relevant manuscript and published variants follows. The variant term 'natural magic,' which appears twice in cancelled form in the Last Draft and nowhere in the 1818, 1823, and 1831 editions, accounts for significant aspects of the published and manuscript texts-the invocation of nature spirits, the term 'dæmon,' references to the moon, and various 'active,' 'sublime,' landscapes, phenomena, and forces. These 'traces' of natural magic significantly counter the impression that, in turning to modern science, Frankenstein entirely forsook the old philosophers. At the same time, the relatively clean writing on the British notebook leaves (the second half of the Last Draft), which seem closer to a previous, now lost rough draft ur-Frankenstein, which the Last Draft roughly copies, than the more heavily revised writing on the Continental notebook leaves, seems also closer to an original more purely gothic and supernatural conception. The overlaid sf conception is largely confined to what appears on the Continental leaves and, especially, the 'Chapt. 2' insert on British leaves (and the corresponding 1818 text).

AB  - This paper considers modern sf fictions and biofictions featuring Romantic-period writers, including works by Brian Aldiss, Tim Powers, William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, Amanda Prantera, and Tom Holland. It considers how the identification by Aldiss and others of Mary Shelley as the 'founding mother' of sf has generated an interest in the lives of Mary and Percy Shelley, Lord Byron and other Romantic-period poets and writers, who have become the subject for time-travel novels and fictions set in an alternate 19th century. It discusses proto-sf themes in Romantic-period works, such as Percy Shelley's and Byron's interest in the theory of Catastrophism. It illustrates the various sf-type angles taken on the reworking of biography by this range of authors, including computer recreations of personality and neo-Gothic interpretations of historical events. It explores the unexpected similarities between biofiction and cyberpunk novels in the treatment of personality, showing how both sub-genres have a postmodern approach to a breaking down of individuality and selfhood. It concludes that Romanticism and postmodernism are the two ends of an arch celebrating human individualism, and that these biofictions link the Neuromancer-or 'New Romancer'-and the Old Romancers by both celebrating and driving a postmodern stake through the heart of Romantic biography.

AB  - Throughout the history of science fiction, alien cultures have appeared in the form of hives. In C.J. Cherryh's Serpent's Reach and Orson Scott Card's Ender trilogy, both of which were conceived in the late 1970s, the authors center hive cultures on the figure of a queen or mother, who dominates the hive, controlling all its members as if they are mere extensions of her body. The adolescent human protagonists in the novels-both of whom have been separated from their families at an early age-develop affinities with this figure. Feminist psychoanalytic theories of mothering came into vogue in the United States in the mid to late 1970s (just before Cherryh and Card conceived of their stories)-most significantly, the theories of Nancy Chodorow and Dorothy Dinnerstein. This feminist psychoanalytic framework helps to reveal the forces which motivate the unique relationships in Cherryh and Card's novels between the protagonists and their alien mothers and between the authors and the alien mothers which they create. The human cultures in these novels are militaristic, capitalistic, and, to coin a phrase, post-maternal (reproduction and caretaking of children is automated or controlled to such an extent as to eliminate the need for a traditional 'mother'). The protagonists' relationships with their alien mothers, as a result, provide an external context through which to expose and critique the ideologies of their own cultures.

AB  - One aspect common to much of Robert A. Heinlein's early work, from the Future History stories through the Scribners juveniles, is his depiction of a Solar System populated in the past or the present by four different extraterrestrial civilizations. These worlds, some extinct and some thriving, serve the purpose of humbling the brash young human species. The self-destructive failures of Luna and Lucifer and the unexpected flourishing of Venus and Mars remind us that humans still have far to progress both intellectually and morally.

AB  - The essay discusses the relationship between body and machine in William Gibson's cyberspace trilogy. The merging of the discourses deriving from the organic and technological worlds in Gibson's texts creates a discursive tension that can be characterised as oxymoronic undecidability. At the level of genre these tensions are articulated between the rational and technological genre of science fiction and the corporeal genre of horror. This cyborg discourse occurs, at the level of experience where man situates him/herself in relation to his/her body and technology, as the tension between two world views, essentialism and culturalism. The central argument of the essay is that Gibson's texts can't resolve these tensions his texts articulate but, by forming generic hybrids, they problematize the traditional Nature-Culture conflict and seek to find new signification practices to conceptualize the new social and cultural space in modernity.

AB  - This article foregrounds the notion of subcultural readings while at the same time interrogating the possibilities of locating and producing 'objective' readings, in particular those readings which depend on a demonstration of authorial 'intent.' Siting itself within current work in Queer Theory, the article problematizes readings of Sheri Tepper's 'Gate to Women's Country' as a feminist utopia by looking at the ways in which the text can be read as anti-sexual. In identifying a climate within Women's Country which is both essentialist with regard to gender and highly conflicted with regard to the idea of women's sexuality, the article demonstrates the way in which female desire is diminished, controlled and normatized. The production of a heteronormative discourse both within and without Women's Country serves, in the end, only to focus the reader's attention on the contradictions inherent in the imposition of a highly regulated heterosexuality on the women in Women's Country. The elimination of choice parallels the elimination within the text of the homosexual as both a potential identity for characters and as an identity embodied within a single character. The article interrogates the text's anxiety around the vanished figure of the homosexual which is present within Stavia's story and is seen at its most glaring in the absence of the figure of Patroclus from the annual play about Achilles that structures and reinforces the central paradigms of Women's Country. Finally, the article asks whether it is possible in the age of AIDS to be wholly accepting of a text that uses the dominant discourses of homophobia to create a world after the homosexual, which is inevitably a world after the sexual.

AB  - In Gibson's 'Neuromancer,' Riviera and Case serve as examples of two creators contrasted by Jean Baudrillard in 'Simulacra and Simulacrum': the specular, discursive representational artist, and the operational adept who efficiently codes the machines which perform work that until recently would have been performed by the specular, discursive imagination. Case and Riviera can be categorized, respectively, as magicians who practice what William Covino has called arresting and generative magic. Case is a cyberspace cowboy who steals or 'arrests' data, working for established power by operating technology, the brainchild of science and corporate power-two voices which constitute official knowledge. Riviera's holographic displays, on the other hand, recreate and disrupt the established flow of events as they are generated by the articulate powers around him. Baudrillard's four phases of the image mark a movement from arresting to generative magic, the most dynamic of these being the second, ripe for a simulation of crisis. The conflict between Molly and Riviera can be read as this kind, staged by the AIs, benefiting their final goal of unifying to become the matrix, that most adept of all generative magicians. Molly 'arrests' Riviera's power by paralyzing him with poison-a simulated death.

AB  - The unique narrative recipe used by Jules Verne to create his 'Voyages Extraordinaires' is characterized not only by repeated reference to the theories and discoveries of real scientists, geographers, historians, and explorers, but also by a wide variety of purely literary intertexts-explicit or implicit allusions to hundreds of authors and works from the 'great works' of Western literature. These literary references function so as to firmly anchor Verne's romans scientifiques to a recognizable cultural tradition, thereby broadening Verne's own literary authoritativeness by identifying his novels more closely with those of the canonical literature(s) of his time. Verne's intertextuality takes many forms: overt literary citations, passing authorial nods, thematic parallels, ideological biases, etc. And the sources come from many historical periods, genres, and nationalities: e.g., from Ovid and Virgil to Defoe and Dickens, and from Baudelaire and Victor Hugo to Goethe and Hoffmann. But the works of three writers, in particular, appear to have exerted a powerful influence on Verne and seem especially ubiquitous throughout the Voyage Extraordinaires: James Fenimore Cooper, Sir Walter Scott, and Edgar Allan Poe.

KW  - film
KW  - technology
AB  - In his study of the cultural effects of technology, Robert Romanyshyn argues that it produces a sense of 'distance from matter,' a detachment from the everyday world we inhabit. We can observe both a consciousness of this 'distance,' as well as two different attitudes towards it in several closely related 'utopian' films produced in the Machine Age. Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis' (1926) in various ways evokes that sense of distance in order to interrogate the promise of a thoroughly technologized world. The result is what many see as the prototypic dystopian film. Closely modeled on 'Metropolis' in its visual design, the American film 'Just Imagine' (1930) similarly evokes distance, but with the aim of denying the distancing, alienating effects of modern technology. Viewed together, these two science-fiction films suggest the competing cultural attitudes towards science and technology at work in Western society during the Machine Age.

AB  - The historical and political implications of the science-fiction/fantasy anthology television series 'The Twilight Zone' (1959-64) and 'The Outer Limits' (1963-65) in the Kennedy era are considered. Science fiction is usually a politically reverberant genre, frequently given to social allegory. These two fondly remembered programs often presented speculative and unsettling political visions of American society. The article considers the issues, events, and ideology represented in these programs in the early 1960s as the nation gradually slid from global Cold War into a hot war in Vietnam. A marked transition in the portrayal of Cold War themes in popular culture from the 1950s to the 1960s is illustrated by segments of each show that explicitly take contemporary issues as their subjects. The episodes surveyed both build on themes from cinematic science fiction of the 1950s and depart from them in important ways. The programs' treatment of such themes, for example, the portrayal of the nuclear war threat before and after the Cuban Missile Crisis, yields historically intriguing equivocations and textual contradictions in sharp contrast to the categorical anticommunism of such McCarthy era programs as I Led Three Lives (1953-56).

AB  - The manipulation of reality and appearance that figures so prominently in Philip K. Dick's fiction remain a subject of persistent interest. This interest extends from Dick's work through to some important themes in recent cultural studies. In both cases, purely philosophical speculation on the nature of 'reality' extends into theoretical and political reflection. In both Dick's work and cultural studies, faith in the existence of a single, present, 'given' world is shown to be theoretically questionable and politically compromised. Dick's Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch offers a particularly apt example of the interplay between metaphysics and politics in Dick's work, and a good example of the way recent cultural studies construes that interaction as well.

KW  - Ralph 124C41+ (1925)
AB  - Hugo Gernsback's influential novel 'Ralph 124C 41+' first appeared as a twelve-part serial in Gernsback's Modern Electrics, otherwise a newsy magazine for inventors. The 1911-12 text is essentially two different stories: the first seven installments are a placid travel tale about Ralph's future utopian Earth; the last five installments feature more scientific facts and are a melodramatic, at times horrific, space adventure involving pursuit of two villains, three violent deaths, and revival of a corpse. The shifts to space and an emphasis on scientific education were inspired by Mark Wicks' To Mars via the Moon, reviewed in a 1911 issue of Modern Electrics, while the shift to melodrama reflected other popular fiction of the time. The 1911-12 text also had passionate romantic passages that were later shortened and toned down because Gernsback thought they were ridiculous, as shown by his parodies of Ralph published in the magazine. Revising the text for 1925 book publication, Gernsback added six new chapters, worked to better integrate the two parts of his story by including foreshadowing elements in earlier chapters, tried to make information-conveying conversations more plausible, added passages of satire, developed the contrasting characters of his two villains, and occasionally improved its prose. The 1929 Amazing Stories Quarterly version, edited by T. O'Conor Sloane, made no substantive changes but at times weakened its logic and worsened its prose style. For the 1950 Second Edition, Gernsback made minor changes to update its contents and improve its prose. The 1958 paperback edition, anonymously copyedited, removed all diagrams, slightly shortened the text, and modernized the prose in several places. A text that straddles traditional boundary lines in science fiction-science/literature, thinking/dreaming, utopia/dystopia-Ralph also encapsulates the modern history of science fiction, first beginning with travel tale and utopia, shifting to melodrama and Gothic horror, and finally striving to integrate those elements with the added genre of satire.

AB  - The early works of William S, Burroughs, including Naked Lunch and the subsequent 'science-fiction' texts Nova Express, The Soft Machine, and The Ticket that Exploded, embody principles of communication strategies which are central to the notion of cyberpunk writng. Burroughs ought thus to be understood as a writer of both theory and fiction in the same sense that Donna Haraway, Jean Baudrillard, Felix Guattari, and Gilles Deleuze are considered to be (Csiscery-Ronay, Bukatman). Burroughs' attempt to integrate the generative forces of chaos into his work have strongly influenced the theory of Guattari and Deleuze and the fiction of William Gibson. Burroughs demonstrates how contact with chaos is crucial for any communication which seeks to escape the normalizing forces of cybernetically-organized systems of domination, including language itself.

AB  - The fictions of feminist-oriented cyborg writers such as Pat Cadigan, Misha, Laura J. Mixon, Lisa Mason, and Sue Thomas indicate a critique and refiguration of the gendered humanist subject. However, the emerging subjectivity depicted in feminist cyborg literature is not necessarily as anti-humanist as cyberpunk literature. Instead, such novels as Synners, Red Spider White Web, Glass Houses, Arachne, and Correspondence entertain various ways of incorporating the marginalized, feminized body into what is traditionally constructed as the masculine transcendent mind. The cyborgs of these novels, associated with the Alien Other Feminine, are representations of a subjectivity which will not be cured of its humanist foundations. Rather, these cyborgs are mind-driven, willful agents even as they are commodified, technologized bodies. Feminist cyborg literature articulates our culture's inescapable humanist dream of transcendence while creatively addressing the condition of diversity in gender, technology, and biology.

AB  - This article explores Dracula, Siegel's Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and Kaufman's Invasion of the Body Snatchers as texts which complicate stable masculinity by introducing a body in flux. The vampiric body and the replicant body are read as instances of a one-sex body, following Thomas Laqueur's study of pre-18th-century Western anatomical models. The article argues that the metaphor of the one-sex body resurfaces in these three works, all of which attempt to ground their treatments of sex/gender in the two-sex model, due to their cultural production at historical moments in which traditional gender alignments were in flux.

AB  - Until very recently, cyberpunk has been a predominantly masculinist project with few strong female characters. Often characterized by a nostalgia for an organic, pastoral past, feminist sf remains largely untouched by cyberpunk's enthusiasm for technology. In the last few years, however, a handful of feminist writers have ventured into the field of cyberpunk, engaging with, and even taking pleasure in, the technology that their feminist predecessors avoided while overturning the politics of gender and sexuality espoused by their masculinist predecessors. The characters in feminist cyberpunk blur the boundaries between human and machine, human and animal, and the real and the unreal, deconstructing the human body without forgetting the real exploitation of specifically female bodies. The characters are partial, fragmented, polluted, yet ultimately successful. Feminist cyberpunk envisions something that feminist theory badly needs: multiply positioned subjects who can negotiate and succeed in a high-tech, postmodern world.

AB  - Apocalypse in sf is often linked to a utopian transformation that creates a 'brave new world' on the ruins of the old one. This is a pattern that has often been noted by critics. However, a number of sf works display an interesting twist on this pattern, linking the apocalypse and the subsequent utopian transformation to the solution of an ontological mystery. Thus, they form an sf subgenre that might be described as the 'ontological detective story.' The typical plot of the ontological detective story, exemplified by Christopher Priest's Inverted World (1979), centers on the protagonist growing up in a world whose nature he/she does not understand. The world, then, is presented as a mystery to be solved, often with criminal undertones (the sinister conspiracy of an elite group), that further link this sf subgenre to the classic detective story. The solution of the mystery precipitates a wholesale ontological transformation, described in a language borrowed from the millenarian tradition of eschatological speculations. The article discusses this plot pattern in a number of recent sf works, such as Gary Kilworth's Theatre of Timesmiths (1984), Ian Watson's THE RIVER trilogy (1985, 1985, 1986), and Michaela Roessner's Vanishing Point (1993). It analyses the ideological implications of the ontological detective story as a generic hybrid between mystery fiction and utopia. While on the one hand the subgenre borrows its rationalistic bend and belief in the power of knowledge from the classic detective story, on the other hand it contains quasi-mystical elements, ultimately deriving from the Book of Revelation. Thus, it can be seen as grappling with the contemporary problematic of history in which the historical process often appears as an irrational nightmare or an enigma waiting for a solution. Yet the ontological detective story also demonstrates that no solution is final as the subgenre itself endlessly repeats the cycle of mystery-apocalypse-utopia.

AB  - With the postcolonial writings of Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, and Rob Nixon as a theoretical base, I argue that the Japanese-occupied PSA of Philip K. Dick's 'The Man in the High Castle' represents an America colonized and oppressed by a simulation of itself. In effect, Dick's Japanese have colonized America following the guidelines set in Asia by Western imperialists. As products of centuries of Western colonization themselves, Dick's Japanese characters, Tagomi and the Kasouras, are mirror images of Western ideals and values, reflecting back the West's Orientalist construction of the East. At the same time, Dick's 'native' Americans, especially Childan, are parodies of nonwestern peoples displaced through colonization. Because Dick's colonized state is enforced by people constructed by Western colonialism and through the same values and practices upon which the United States was founded, 'The Man in the High Castle' interrogates Americanism, our cherished beliefs about America, as a world view along-side the Taoism and Nazism of America's 'colonizers.'

AB  - The science-fiction film seems grounded in a constant tension between the speculative and the visceral, between our hopes for what might be and our very human-and physical-fears of what such developments could entail. The recent British film 'Hardware' particularly reflects this tension. In fact, it foregrounds that tension by 'quoting' numerous other science- fiction and horror films-by a sort of collage strategy that enables it to frame key questions about the nature of the science-fiction genre, about the technology from which it draws its life, and about what audiences expect from such films. In its reflexive treatment of what has become a commonplace of recent science-fiction films, that is, a deadly confrontation between humans and a humanly-crafted/human-destroying robot, 'Hardware' not only raises the usual concerns about the fragile nature of humanity and the threatening potential of our technology; it also suggests how our films-themselves a product of technological craft-can help us deal with those concerns by drawing on that generic tension to better 'frame,' as Heidegger put it, our humanness.

AB  - Two recent works by Kim Stanley Robinson, 'A History of the Twentieth Century, with Illustrations' (1991) and A Short, Sharp Shock (1990) are 'dialogical twins' in that they examine the same problem of human subjectivity as a relational and historical process. Both tell a story of a rational male subject in a violent world, and both use the struggles of this broadly representative protagonist to question gender-neutral explanations of the modern human condition. Both narratives are preoccupied with memory and with 'topography,' with mapping physical, historical, and psychic journeys. Both Everyman protagonists travel to a physical and historical end that demands the question 'what next?' Both stories suggest that we can't imagine a better 'what next' unless we reconsider Western Civilization's master narrative of how humans get to be rational adults. This narrative presumes two conditions for personhood: complete differentiation from and conflict with others whose own subjectivity must remain problematic for the rational subject. Thus selfhood is defined as an autonomy suspicious of and in conflict with other selves, and this supposedly unique and inevitable mode of subjectivity is used to explain the continuing strife in human relations. By retelling this same old story vividly, Robinson's 'twin' stories question its adequacy, suggesting that the master narrative of how humans become rational subjects is not the full and coherent map it purports to be. Instead, both stories suggest that the master narrative is 'androcentric,' conflating human with male human, and positing the female as exemplary 'Other,' who symbolically represents the lack of both reason and subjectivity in order to undergird the position of the rational male subject. 'A History of the Twentieth Century, with Illustrations' and A Short, Sharp Shock call attention to how cultural space has been 'gendered' according to this androcentric, binary model of sexual difference. In different ways, both stories retrace the male public and female private, or domestic, spaces that have structured experience at least since the Enlightenment, Industrial Revolution, and the rise of the middle class and of capitalism. Both stories estrange readers from this 'gendered geography' by reversing or otherwise disrupting its public/private topography. Finally, both struggle to tell an 'other' story of subjectivity embodied in both female and male humans, and founded on relations other than the imperative to differentiate from and then to dominate or submit to the 'Other.' Robinson's male protagonists resist being 'written' as exemplary rational subjects who must doubt others' subjectivity in order to believe in their own. Homeless, since they don't fit into the narratives of post-Enlightenment patriarchy, these subjects-in-crisis, melancholy travelers, are feeling their way to a post-patriarchal landscape.

AB  - This article examines William Gibson's concept of cyberspace, as it is elaborated in his novel Neuromancer, in the context of his Mervyn Kihn stories, 'The Gernsback Continuum' and 'Hippie Hat Brain Parasite.' These stories deal directly with present-day survivals of the nineteen sixties and the nineteen thirties; Gibson's use of hallucinatory iconography associated with the sixties and 'visionary futurism' associated with the thirties in his visual descriptions of cyberspace hints at the relevance of these stories for interpreting the construct of cyberspace. Ultimately, rather than presenting cyberspace as a liberatory, utopian space, as some postmodern theorists would have it, Gibson's treatment of hallucinatory and futuristic iconographies suggests that cyberspace functions as the embodiment of past 'Dreams' of the future, dreams which, Gibson hints, are at least partially responsible for the 'near dystopia' of the present.

KW  - American literature
AB  - Wylie draws on partially secularized versions of the apocalyptic paradigm in his science-fiction writings in order to attack the failings of the American people. Disaster functions as a repeated test of national morale, inventiveness, and political preparedness. His collaborative novels, When Worlds Collide and After Worlds Collide, use biblical analogy to underscore America's manifest destiny to survive and then polarize the action into a struggle between the forces of freedom and despotism. In his 1942 treatise on contemporary morals, Generation of Vipers, Wylie most clearly exemplifies his desire to address his country as a whole, and in his fiction on the Cold War he repeatedly mixes genres or moves beyond the confines of realism to cope with the urgencies of the nuclear age. The Answer and The Disappearance use parables to examine dogma and gender rigidity, while his more famous novel, Tomorrow! (1954), attempts to address the civil defense issue by describing the immediacy of atomic attack. However, this novel takes description beyond the limits of credibility and then undermines the whole issue of civil defense by introducing a coda on the H-bomb. The attendant shift in scale informs the novel Triumph, which attacks the whole idea of superpower confrontation by showing a nuclear exchange where the entire northern hemisphere is destroyed. The End of the Dream, Wylie's last novel, also attacks national failure, this time by grafting the terminology of nuclear attack on to environmental destruction. Triumph evokes the bleak spectacle of the literal erasure of the USA from the continent; The End of the Dream foresees an equally dark future where America has slid into totalitarianism. The destructive potential of military technology now expresses itself as Nature's quasi-divine reactions to ecological upheaval.

AB  - The 'Moi-peau' of Leto II in Herbert's Atreides saga offers an interpretation of the enigmatic personality of Leto II, Paul Atreides' son, and may open new perspectives on the meaning of the whole cycle of Dune. From a psychoanalytical point of view, Leto's evolution and irreversible metamorphosis into a Sandworm, as described in Children of Dune and God-Emperor of Dune, is a perfect illustration of a paroxysmal autistic behavior whose oedipal implications may be a key to the Atreides saga. By supplanting his father at the expense of his humanity and sanity, Leto eventually manages to satisfy his lust for absolute power and to achieve the great scheme which Paul himself shrank from. Based on the theory of the French psychoanalyst Didier Anzieu, whose best-known work, Le Moi-peau (1985), has had a considerable impact in France on the academic as well as psychoanalytical world, this study aims at showing that the monstrous skin of Leto is in fact a powerful metaphor of the Atreides psychotic universe. By isolating himself from the rest of mankind and proclaiming himself God and Emperor of Dune, he confirms the postulate according to which 'Power attracts the psychotics. Always.'

AB  - Periodic interest in Jules Verne's novels has often been sparked by film adaptations. One of the most famous of these is the 1954 Disney film of '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'. This film may be read as a symbolic text exploring myths of masculinity, science, technology, and power. Reading the film against the original novel reveals a pattern of changes and shifts in the four main characters and their relationships. Produced under the shadow of the Cold War and the launching of the first nuclear submarine-named the Nautilus after Captain Nemo's famous boat-the Disney film of Leagues shows viewers a Nemo grown far less heroic. The enigmatic captain emerges as a desperate fugitive dogged by military and imperialist powers, rather than the infallible champion of science as a means to freedom from the surface world of European empires and warfare. Disney's film elevates the American, Ned Land, a working-class sailor and harpooner, to the level of hero, suggesting that brawn and not brains is the true source of male power. Analysis of the symbolic undercurrents of the texts reveals a struggle for the symbolic phallus of the fathers and the Promethean fire of intellectual and technological superiority. Between Verne and Disney, an ideology of individualism and anti-intellectualism struggles with the Vernian romance of technological man. An image of men as cooperating brothers sharing a love for Nature clashes with the image of men as inevitably subordinated to institutional brotherhoods founded on violence, competition, conquest, and the repression of the individual.

KW  - film
KW  - social reality
KW  - suburbia
AB  - The two film versions of 'Invaders from Mars' provide crucial insight into the historical trajectory of suburbanization in the United States. Beneath its surface confidence in the postwar suburban project as a geographical resolution of abiding class conflict, the first film, released in 1953 during escalating Cold War preparedness, evinces deep-seated anxieties about the ethical implications of suburbia's essential dependence upon militarist power. The remake, released in 1986 at the height of Ronald Reagan's reinvigoration of the military-industrial foundations of suburban life, offers a pointed satire of contemporary suburbia's jingoistic antagonism toward alien 'others'-a mistrust which bespeaks a growing racial division within U.S. society that is the historical fallout of the suburbanization process. Both films display the power of the cinematic genre of science fiction to condense complex historical developments into visually arresting-even prophetic-images.

AB  - This essay considers the synchronous appearance of two similar narrative forms-time travel and the modernist geometrical narrative. In both traditional plot and character are reduced to games of logic and geometrical arabesque. And for both, the result is to transpose traditional story spacetime into the realm of temporal paradox. This comparison however leads to discovery of significant differences. If in both time travel and modernist narrative, time is subject to logical manipulation, the form and meaning of this act, in what are two quite distinct cultural contexts, is very different. What does it mean for the modernist to 'manipulate' time? What can this mean in terms of the empirical or 'physical' imperative of sf? These questions offer insight into the nature and extent of experimentation with spacetime categories in modern narrative. To answer them, we offer close readings of two contemporaneous works: Borges's 'Death and the Compass,' and Heinlein's 'By His Bootstraps.'

AB  - The article discusses the generic nature of the Strugatsky brothers' oeuvre in terms of two opposing generic modes: sf and allegory. Allegory is seen as striving to produce a total control of meaning and to direct the reader's hermeneutical activity to a specific end, while sf texts are open to multiple interpretations. Allegory is widespread in authoritarian societies as a strategy of protection against censorship; neverthless, it is an itself an authoritarian form whose rigid structure often runs counter to its politically subversive meaning. In the Strugatsys' works allegory appears first as a subsidiary generic element but its importance intensifies toward the end of their joint career. Their major novels are discussed as structured by the tension between allegory and sf.

AB  - There is a dominant trend in postmodern analyses of literature and culture to reject origin stories because they, like all such master narratives, are seen to produce only oppressive, essentialist identities. Far from 'forsaking the pursuit of the origin,' however, I read Octavia Butler's Xenogenesis trilogy as contesting origin stories on their own turf. This paper maps Butler's use of our culture's most powerful origin stories: the Biblical, the sociobiological, the paleoanthropological, and the African-American story of diaspora and slavery. In the process of putting these stories into dialogue, the trilogy exposes the stakes involved in continuing to tell and retell origin stories, and helps readers imagine the origins of identity in powerful new ways.

AB  - The recent publication in France of a 'lost' novel by Jules Verne called Paris au XXe siècle (Paris in the 20th Century) is of watershed importance in two rather ironic ways. On the one hand, it refutes the false but enduringly popular notion that Verne was always an apostle of scientific progress; on the other, it confounds certain literary scholars who have sought to redefine Verne's relationship to sf. For the former, this chillingly dystopian portrait of Parisian life in 1960-63 is totally inconsistent with what the general public has come to expect from the legendary 'Father of Science Fiction,' at least from his most famous works. For the latter, the publication of Paris au XXe siècle comes as an unexpected bombshell. After having clearly demonstrated that Verne's similar tale called 'In the Year 2889' (among many other works attributed to him) was actually written by Verne's son Michel, respected literary critics had begun to assert that-despite his reputation in America-Verne never wrote a truly futuristic novel and therefore should not be viewed as a writer of 'real' sf at all. The existence of Paris au XXe siècle is proof to the contrary.

AB  - In 'The Female Man' Russ contrasts our present-day heterosexual society with two revolutionary alternatives: a utopian world of women and a dystopian world of women warring with men. The novel functions as what Monique Witting calls a 'literary war machine' because it tries 'to pulverize the old forms and formal conventions.' Specifically, Russ critiques the 'straight mind'-heterosexual institutions that regulate gender-by showing how two representatives from 'our world' respond to those institutions. She also shows two alternative worlds that further undermine, but do not solve, the way heterosexual institutions regulate gender. In responding to the straight mind and to the consequences of being the female Other, one character from 'our world,' Joanna, changes into a female man. Joanna becomes the female man by appropriating language and therefore 'resolv[ing] contrarieties, [by] unit[ing] them in her own person,' and in this way she destroys gender as Witting describes by 'lay[ing] claim to universality.' Russ contrasts Joanna's solution with the alternative worlds inhabited by Janet (on the all-women utopian Whileaway) and by the cyborg Jael (on the dystopian world of warring Manland and Womanland). Russ's literary war machine deploys various weapons against the Straight Mind. Of these, the most successful is language, which allows women to kill the myth of Woman and to abolish the class of women. In short, Russ demonstrates Judith Butler's suggestion that women can 'speak their way out of their gender.'

AB  - In 1928, Hugo Gernsback sponsored a contest to devise a symbol for sf, launching the creation of visual definitions of sf. The symbols he presented-an eye, gears driving a pen-suggest that sf means a type of perception or process of writing; but a later symbol he offered-a spaceship-became the most common symbol, suggesting only that sf meant stories about space travel. Popular symbols with similar meanings include Saturn, an atom, and aliens. Such symbols connect sf to hard science and juvenile adventure, explaining in part why these associations remain strong. Bookcovers offer alternative visualizations of sf-collages, alien landscapes, adaptations of classic artworks, abstract scenes-but no symbols to date are fully satisfactory.

AB  - Although one of the most prominent writers (and theorists) of science fiction in France throughout the period of 1900-1930, Maurice Renard has heretofore received very little critical attention outside his native land. His neglect among Anglo-American literary scholars is most likely the result of two factors: first, very few English translations of Renard's works exist (and those that do are of inferior quality) and, second, the basic nature of Renard's sf tends to challenge our more modern notions of genre specificity when defining the sf canon-i.e., his stories appear to continually cross the line into Gothic horror, mythological fantasy, and detective mysteries. This article presents a brief synopsis of Maurice Renard's life and literary ideas (e.g., the 'scientific-marvellous'), and offers a detailed discussion of Renard's many novels and short stories, which, often resembling a kind of cross-hybridization between Wells and Poe, can together perhaps best be labelled 'fantastic sf.'

AB  - Since the 1970s, science fiction has provided a discursive space which has enabled women writers both to criticize current social practices and to speculate on alternative social arrangements. Angela Carter's 'Passion of New Eve' represents, in relation to this particular perspective, an original and innovative reconfiguration of characteristic female and/or feminist motifs, such as the representation of urban technological space, the idea of a gynocratic community, and the sociological implications of male power in society. In this view, Carter's novel not only conveys a comprehensive and complex view of reality, but also makes for a definite and original literary experience exploiting all possible narrative devices to their fullest. Three different types of communities are described, each of them embedding a specific side of the female stereotype. The first of these highly symbolic places is New York, the post-modern metropolis, the ideal background for an image of the woman as a prostitute, an empty body offering infinite sexual pleasures. The second is Beulah, which offers a completely different perspective: being a feminist separatist community, it is planned and described as a metaphor of totalitarian female power. Finally, Zero's town again reverses perspectives, offering a nightmarish image of women as house-wives/slaves. Through a close analysis of the structural and stylistic devices operating in each part of the novel, it is possible to map out the psychological journey of the protagonist towards his/her identification. The phases of this journey are marked by three physical metamorphoses implying individual as well as gender problems. The changes in the body of Evelvn/Eve are duplicated through the description of highly hybrid spaces, mostly defined by unresolvable dichotomies. The outer journey reflects metaphorically the inner quest of a human being looking for his/her own true gender.

AB  - Much of Alfred Bester's fiction is concerned with the themes of imprisonment and release. His settings frequently are closed spaces such as prisons, hospitals, rocket ships and laboratories. His rhetorical devices include a vocabulary of keys, walls, doors, and traps, and his use of techniques such as repetition and prolepsis contributes to an air of predetermination that hangs over most of his work. Bester is interested in the prison as the site of psychological catalysis. Those characters who undergo imprisonment may wind up with disastrous psychic damage or, conversely, may find spiritual enlightenment. In Bester's most famous stories, the characters who emerge from the darkness of imprisonment into self-illumination may grow to lead others in their society to seek their own freedom.

AB  - The intense political commitment that informs Marge Piercy's Woman on the Edge of Time (1976) and He, She, and It (1991) is not unique in dystopian fiction, a genre that lends itself to political statement and social criticism. Piercy's avowedly feminist stance is, however, relatively unusual in a genre that has traditionally been dominated by male writers and masculine concerns. Moreover, both books reinforce their political statements with innovative literary techniques. In particular, both books generate considerable dialogic energy from mixtures of different social discourses and genres. Woman on the Edge of Time, for example, is a largely utopian work that contrasts an idealized future feminist utopia with the conditions of Piercy's contemporary America. But it contrasts this utopian future with a projected dystopian alternative, while at the same time complicating its message with a number of complex modernist writing strategies that help the book escape the finality and stasis that have traditionally been associated with utopian thought. The later He, She, and It, meanwhile, draws upon the work of writers like Joanna Russ, Donna Haraway, and William Gibson to update Piercy's feminist intervention in the dystopian/utopian tradition in ways that account for the recent social impact of computer technology. Together, Piercy's two dystopian works indicate the potential of this traditionally masculine genre for feminist political statement.

KW  - war
AB  - The longstanding relationship between technological fantasies and American military culture and policy, well chronicled up to the Vietnam War in the work of H. Bruce Franklin, has developed even further in the last twenty years. The significant 'future war' subculture within sf and the techno-thriller genre share a surprising number of participants, metaphors, and ideological positions with the command, planning, and R&D subsections of the US military. In some places the discourses of sf and real war have become one and the same. Sf publications, for example J.E. Pournelle's There Will Be War series, are used for straightforward ideological ends (and to turn a profit of course). But it turns out to be a complex ideology. Beneath the traditional defense of militaristic virtues such as warrior masculinity, preparedness, and nationalism in these Future War stories, there is also a close adherence to many of the central ideological assumptions of high-tech postmodern war. Specifically: epistemophilia and infomania (that information, either tactical, strategic, or scientific, is the most crucial military and social resource); cyborgism (the presumed superiority of man-machine information and weapon systems); technophilia and computerism (machines win wars rationally, computers are the most important war machines); simulationism (simulations and modeling are just another aspect of the real); extraterrestriality (space is a necessity, militarily and culturally); and warism (war is natural and inevitable). Noticing these ideological assumptions is a crucial step toward understanding the dynamics of war today, and inevitably of peace as well. Technological invention/construction and scientific discovery/experiment are acts of imagination before they are acts with artifacts. In this age, where future imagined wars, ancient mythopoetical conflicts, and real wars seem so capable of mutually reinforcing each other, a close look at future-war sf shows that it is an understandable process. Thus it reveals how we can also imagine, even understand, quite different ends and means than future war, if we use different assumptions at the start.

AB  - This article engages with recent theoretical work which has developed the notion of texts offering models of reading for their readers. More specifically, it looks at ways in which science-fiction texts position readers, and at the ways in which political texts comment on their own reading processes and propagandizing strategies. A comparative analysis of George Orwell's 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' (1949) and Katharine Burdekin's neglected feminist dystopia 'Swastika Night' (1937) focuses on a textual device common to both. The reading process of subjects in dystopia is explored: both Winston Smith and Burdekin's Alfred are presented reading political texts, secret books. 'Swastika Night' and 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' are political texts intended to influence readers, embedded in which are scenes where political texts influence readers. The article discusses the significance of these scenes, which are both self-referential and extratextual It identifies and explores some of the problems of the parallel activities of the reader in the text and that outside the text-you, me. It concludes by arguing for an auto-critical impulse in dystopia, which is also a source of narrative-even propagandizing-energy.

AB  - Pamela Zoline's 'The Heat Death of the Universe' (1967), in which a domestic narrative of a day in the life of California housewife Sarah Boyle is punctuated by ruminations on entropy, chaos, and the heat death of the universe, often has been argued to belong only marginally to the category of sf. Zoline, like many other New Wave writers who were publishing in New Worlds, is claimed to occupy only a liminal status in sf. By situating Zoline in the context of her New Worlds' publication as well as within the thermodynamic concerns of the 1960s New Wave writers, I argue that questions of generic identity and dissolution are precisely what is at issue in 'Heat Death.' The thematic structures that organize 'Heat Death'-housework and the exhaustion of Sarah Boyle and the second law of thermodynamics and the exhaustion of the universe-offer an elegant allegory for reading Zoline's generic theory of sf, which is to sustain a generic identity that will not overdetermine the many texts seeking its shelter and, at the same time, will not give up a fruitful critical difference in the imagination of a utopian field of textual equality.

AB  - In his novels about Contact With Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CETI), Stanislaw Lem investigates humankind's ability to understand the nature and actions of alien Others. This essay explores the way Lem uses the language and concepts of Christian theology to frame the ontological and moral implications of Contact. Focusing on his most recently translated CETI novel, Fiasco, it argues that his thinking about the possibility of peaceful Contact has changed significantly over the years: where early novels like Eden and Solaris hold out the possibility of communication, or at least stalemate, between humankind and alien, Lem's latest work describes a violent escalation that begins with incomprehension and fear of the Other, and ends in exocide. Lem's point seems to be increasingly that science cannot provide meaningful guidelines for moral action in the face of the unknown. He illustrates this in Fiasco by assigning the role of skeptic not to a scientist, as in his previous works (including The Invincible and His Master's Voice), but to a Dominican moral theologian.

AB  - This essay treats four works by Kim Stanley Robinson: three Mars narratives from the eighties-Icehenge (1984), 'Exploring Fossil Canyon' (1982) and 'Green Mars' (1985)-and Pacific Edge (1990), the ecotopian 'conclusion' of his Orange county trilogy. In these science fictions Robinson writes utopia not so much as an alternative social structure but as an alternative historical process that emerges from the intersecting histories of subjects. Like many contemporary feminists, Robinson portrays subjectivity as a largely opaque, never-finished process that is constituted as much through a need to recognize the subjectivity and difference of others as through a need for others to recognize one's own (constantly changing) subjectivity. I argue that Robinson inscribes a feminist vision of subjectivity as intersubjectivity in his characterizations, imagery, plots, and narrative strategies in general, and that this vision of the alterity of the self and the subjectivity of the other is the enabling condition for his privileged but alienated protagonists to act and to link their individual histories to utopia as alternative historical process.

KW  - Polish literature
AB  - Since its origination with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, sf has served as an oppositional literature to science-as-colonialism, or science as the quest for control over evolution, nature, and nations. In responding to 19th-century dialogues about scientific man's mastery of nature and the imperialist thrust to maintain subject races, Shelley created the first in a line of man-made monster offspring who successfully resist destruction and servitude. Shelley's daemon resists domination by refusing oversignification via either/or dualisms such as man/monster, insisting on both his humanity and his monstrosity. In contemporary sf, resisting monsters, such as cyborgs and aliens, take up the daemon's demand by refusing totalizing identities and by insisting on their own multiple subjecthoods and the multiple perspectives these bring. Rheya, from Stanislaw Lem's novel 'Solaris,' is just such a resisting monster. She is a multiply constructed, ontologically vexed being, manufactured by a sentient, alien Ocean from an image in the mind of her lover, Kelvin, a male scientist. By confusing boundaries such as subject/object, human/nonhuman, and biological entity/machine, Rheya resists colonization via oversignification and builds her own subjectivity, escaping the bounds set for her by her Ocean creator, by Kelvin, and by the text.

KW  - American literature
AB  - Strong similarities and sharp contrasts exist between Robert Heinlein's The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress and Ursula K. Le Guin's The Dispossessed. Both books experiment imaginatively with anarchist societies that develop from colonies of exile, on a moon in Heinlein's book and on a twin planet in Le Guin's. In both cases, selective immigration, harsh new environment, and enforced isolation from the decaying parent culture dictate new social patterns. Extrapolating these new directions in which society might grow allows each author to create a model based on chosen philosophical principles. For Heinlein, the principles might be described as 'masculine,' individualist, libertarian, laissez-faire capitalist, anarchist, and Christian. For Le Guin, the principles might be described as feminist, communal, centrally coordinated, anarchist, and Taoist. In spite of plot similarities between the books, the governing principles chosen by the two writers are often nearly diametrical in their opposition. The one exception to this is anarchism, which both books seem to espouse. Fundamentally, though, even this is a difference: Le Guin's anarchism is based on faith in the cooperative nature of humans, while Heinlein's is based on belief in the ultimate inability of large groups of humans to cooperate rationally. Like the adversarial but inescapably linked societies represented by Le Guin and Heinlein, these two books orbit each other, exerting strong mutual gravitational forces. Neither can be understood alone.

AB  - Postmodernisms reject both realism/antirealism and determinism/indeterminism as western ontological binaries. In this context, William Gibson can be read for residual modes of thinking: his fiction invokes western ontological terms, in conjunction with 'romantic' patterns of depth and surface. Determinism and indeterminism form a simple narrative binary. Romantic strains oppose both determinism and indeterminism by affirming meanings outside the realm of signs, giving rise to a triadic narrative pattern of opposition and overlap. At the same time, this narrative pattern reintroduces traditional modes of representation, where 'meaning' is finally located within depth, ambiguity, and metaphor.

AB  - While topographical and topical (i. e., extrapolative) considerations remain essential to analysis of 'hard' and 'soft' sf, the primacy of topos in critical discourse has resulted in the neglect or misreading of such visionary, post-utopian writers as Frank Herbert, Theodore Sturgeon and Cordwainer Smith, whose work (emphasizing symbolic displacement, not topographical orientation) goes against the grain of sf's utopian heritage. All good fiction in any of the sf subgenres will be careful partially to defamiliarize the landscape; but visionary sf goes further, insisting upon the utterly inexplicable or singular nature of the hero's experience (his/her narrative 'place'). Such post-utopian heroes as Paul and Virginia in Smith's 'Alpha Ralpha Boulevard'-a story set at a point in Smith's future history where 'eutopia' has been achieved but rejected-test the limits of the rational and discover its tragic insufficiency. Smith's stylized language and ruminative (not neatly extrapolated) narrative pacing show his rejection of the functional narrative design of both hard and soft sf, where 'heroes' serve to flesh out the topos, serving transparently as incarnations or emblems of an author's intentions. (Two examples from hard and soft sf respectively are Robert Heinlein's 'Man' in The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and Ursula LeGuin's 'Ai'-'I'-in The Left Hand of Darkness.) Beginning with discussion of a spectrum of sf approaches to characterization-with hard and soft sf at one extreme and space-opera at the other-this essay situates the post-utopian heroes of Frank Herbert, Theodore Sturgeon and Cordwainer Smith at a dramatic and neglected midpoint, arguing that criticism (hampered by its long obsession with topos) has not yet begun to do justice to sf's visionaries.

AB  - A recurring image in J.G. Ballard's fiction is the Dead City. The deluged London of 'The Drowned World' (1962), the anonymous metropolis in 'The Ultimate City' (1976), and the desertified New York City and the tropical Las Vegas of 'Hello America' (1981) represent four speciments of this apocalyptic symbol. A 'stratigraphic'-i.e., comparative-analysis of these urban landscapes reveals a profound change in Ballard's attitude. The first two works mentioned draw their deep structures from an archetypal and anthopological reading of the English literary tradition (T.S. Eliot, Joyce, and Shakespeare). 'Hello America', by contrast, offers a visionary paraphrase of American history and pop mythology. That novel distinguishes itself from the earlier two titles in transcending the historical horizon, but not in a sense that would make 'transcendence' synonomous with 'obliteration.'

AB  - One notable element of SF criticism is the constant repetition of pronouncements suggesting the impending death of the genre. From academic criticism to magazine columns, the threat of the death of SF is a persistent motif. The polemical proposal of this article is that these panic narratives are not attempting to arrest this death, but in fact desire nothing else. SF is ecstatic at the prospect of its own death. This is argued by attending to the way in which SF 'legitimates' itself according to criteria derived from 'high' art. In accepting these criteria SF accepts the equation of the generic with the 'low,' and thus must proceed to 'kill' itself in order to be considered legitimate literature. In the three modes of legitimation that are considered, a particular emphasis is given to narratives of the history of SF which posit some kind of prior mythic moment of SF as undifferentiated from the 'mainstream' of Literature. In that the prospect of death promises a return to that state, the desire of SF is to 'restore an earlier state of things.' This in fact proves to be the exact definition Freud accords to the death drive. The article proposes, then, to follow the curious logic of the detours that constitute the death drive of SF.

AB  - 'Star Trek' emerged from a specific cultural matrix: one of the most profound crises in the history of the United States. At the center of this maelstrom was the Vietnam War, which was radically reshaping the American consciousness during the months when the series was first broadcast between 1966 and 1969. In some senses the war was the subtext for the entire series, with the universe of the aptly-named starship U.S.S. Enterprise serving as both happy sequel and alternative to the actual world of viewers in the America of the 1960s. In 'Star Trek', the prewar faith in a triumphant future for 1950s American values is displaced from an historical Earth to the enclosed world of the Enterprise and an imagined space. 'Star Trek' was also one of the first dramatic series to confront the Vietnam War explicitly. Four episodes in particular express a swiftly changing vision of the war, part of the metamorphosis of American society as it faced defeat in Vietnam and disintegration at home.

AB  - In discussing why Mexico, a nation obsessed with its collective past, does not have a solid tradition in SF, this brief essay examines Carlos Fuentes's interest in chronological and 'cultural' time and analyzes his very limited interest in SF. It distinguishes between SF and mythic writing (i.e., 'magical realism') and, after placing in context some of Fuentes's most celebrated works, focuses on his anti-utopian novel Christopher Unborn, a tribute to H.G. Wells, George Orwell, and Aldous Huxley.

AB  - Evolutionary theory has often figured in science fiction as a powerfully resonant topic, a privileged point of departure for the staging of a variety of highly charged concerns and conflicts. In some narratives, the positing of a shared kinship between humans and other animals provokes revulsion at the implied refusal of any claim to human preeminence in the greater scheme of things. But the erosion of 'Man' as a putatively ontological category and the prospect, moreover, of reality as a Joycean 'chasosmos' of perpetual change or metamorphois can also be depicted affirmatively. The theoretical elaboration of an evolutionary universe need not exclusively elicit horror and anguish. It may also prompt the speculative imagination to extrapolate a future for what might be dubbed 'the post-human body becoming.' This essay examines a number of exemplary responses in SF to the advent of modern evolutionary thought. Discussion focuses in particular on John Carpenter's 1982 version of The Thing and Octavia Butler's more recent Xenogenesis trilogy as evolutionist narratives offering respectively traumatized and affirmative perspectives on a world in which, as Heraclitus long ago put it, 'everything flows and nothing abides, everything gives way and nothing stays fixed.'

KW  - Armageddon
AB  - This survey argues that the substantial sub-genre of SF cinema which has entertained visions of nuclear Armageddon primarily concerns itself with survival as its dominant discursive mode, not disaster as suggested by Susan Sontag. From the early post-Hiroshima films which anticipated global atomic conflict, the '50s cautionary tales of short- and long-term effects, through to '80s hero myths of apocalypse, a discernable shift away from an imagination of disaster toward one of survival is evident. These films have drawn upon pre-existing mythologies of cataclysm and survival in their renderings of post-holocaust life, the most potent being a recasting of the Judeo-Christian messianic hero. The cinematic renderings of long-term post-nuclear survival appear highly reactionary, and seemingly advocate reinforcing the symbolic order of the status quo via the maintenance of conservative social regimes of patriarchal law (and lore). In this way the post-nuclear survivalist cycle of the '80s has signified another mode by which a generation has learned to stop worrying and love-if not the bomb-a (post-holocaust) future, which promises a compelling, utopian fantasy of a biblical Eden reborn in an apocalyptic millennia of peace on Earth.

KW  - scientific approach
AB  - A popular belief during the late 19th and early 20th century held that the image of the last thing seen at the moment of death remained imprinted forever upon the retina of the eye. It was called an 'optogram.' This belief developed concurrently with rapid advances made in photography during this historical period, and was seemingly validated by certain scientific experiments in ocular physiology done in the 1870s. Looking for the 'photo in a dead person's eye' soon became an accepted police investigative procedure and an established touchstone of much turn-of-the-century SF and detective fiction. In later 20th century literature and film, a modern variant of the optogrammic photo emerged: the dead brain itself was now 'read' using hightech scanners to record the deceased's final vision (or thoughts) before death occurred. The goal of this article is to examine this pseudoscientific literary motif, its origins and evolution, and to show how science fact can sometimes become science fiction and take on a life of its own in the popular imagination.

AB  - Although its heyday is over, cyberpunk's influence continues in contemporary SF. This paper examines one of cyberpunk's legacies-the blighted urban landscape as cyberpunk's preferred setting. In classic post-holocaust fictions such as Pat Frank's Alas, Babylon, Walter M. Miller, Jr's A Canticle for Leibowitz, and Russell Hoban's Riddley Walker, the ruined landscape is a sign of alienation, inhospitable and dangerous. In such cyberpunk-inspired novels as Farewell Horizontal by K.W. Jeter, Bone Dance by Emma Bull, and Synners by Pat Cadigan, although the landscape looks much the same as in the post-holocaust stories, it has been transformed from a hostile terrain into a playground of creative possibilities. This acceptance of environmental decay may be one of the enduring themes of cyberpunk. Although cyberpunk's complacency about eco-disaster is troubling, the continued appeal of cyberpunk's geopolitics is its attempt to use the physical world as a way of ushering in emerging technologies and exploring new, non-corporeal modes of being.

AB  - Texts that theorize psi in terms that combine the discourses of spirituality and science pose special problems for SF critics. Popular and scientific interest in evolution and in the psychic phenomena associated with mesmerism which led to speculation about consciousness evolution is seen in the telepathy of such early SF as Poe's 'A Tale of the Ragged Mountains,' Bulwer-Lytton's The Coming Race, Bellamy's 'To Whom This May Come,' and Paine's The Great White Way. Examinations of the problematic interaction between science and spirituality demonstrates the importance of 'psience fiction' in SF history and interrogates the materialist bias of SF criticism.

AB  - Like other popular artforms, science fiction is 'formulaic,' but its formulas, ranging from myth to mathematics, cannot be determined simply by era, setting, type of plot, or conventional values. As a form of fantasy, SF uses exaggeration, inversion, and extension as points of relevance to readers focused on the here and now. Unlike other fantasy, SF relies on science for content and rhetoric, best exemplified today in the subgenre of 'hard SF.' More so than other SF, hard SF is undergirded by the scientific principles of empiricism, determinism, and relativism, with their pragmatic applications of prediction and control. Exaggeration and inversion still have their place as rhetorical ploys, along with satire and allegory, but hard SF is based more on extension. Of the three subdivisions of extension, hard SF relies more on extrapolation than it does on speculation or transformation. Hard SF writers use extrapolation mainly for world-building and forecasting, following variant methodologies. Both rely on the same hard sciences, but forecasting relies more on soft and pseudo-scientific bases. In the creation of characters and forecasts of their behavior, extrapolation has significance on conventional literary levels as well.

AB  - We all know that some hard science fiction, such as the opus of Gregory Benford, is highly literate. Yet is this only because such works are strong in traditionally-recognized qualities of literature like characterization, realistic plots, or the use of metaphors. Can the hard-SF quality itself be literary? The best approach to this question may be to examine SF works like Robert F. Forward's Dragon's Egg, which may lack all the usual literary graces, but which nevertheless evoke authentic literary experiences that go far beyond scientific formulas or wiring diagrams.

AB  - Several commentators in the 1950s visibly searched for a way to describe SF that was especially attentive to science. P. Schuyler Miller, book reviewer for Astounding/Analog, first used the term 'hard science fiction' in November 1957 and used it more frequently in the 1960s. By the mid-1960s, other commentators were also using the term. Early references involved a relatively small number of writers who emphasized scientific accuracy and explanation, but in the 1970s and 1980s, the term expanded to include numerous writers not originally associated with hard SF. Hal Clement's 'Whirligig World' states that the primary goal of hard science fiction is avoiding scientific errors and suggests four strategies for doing so. Two of these-using 'gobbledygook' and speculating in areas where scientific knowledge is limited-are rejected; the other two lead to forms of hard SF: microcosmic hard SF, cautious predictions of near-future technology like Arthur C. Clarke's A Fall of Moondust, and macrocosmic hard sf, extravagant visions of alien environments like Larry Niven's Ringworld. When the characteristics of hard SF are understood, it is clear that while the principles behind hard SF were first articulated by Hugo Gernsback and John W. Campbell Jr, few if any writers before 1950 meet the standards of hard SF. Instead, hard SF should be seen as a development of the 1950s and 1960s, suggesting that versions of science-fiction history treating the 1930s and 1940s as eras of science-dominated SF may need to be rethought. Overall, examining the critical history of hard SF is valuable because it provides solid grounds for firmly and usefully establishing the parameters of hard SF.

AB  - Alien 3 concludes the trilogy begun by Alien and Aliens; although each of the films has a different director, there is enough thematic unity between them to consider them a single work. Previous criticism has focussed on the implications for feminism in the role of the protagonist, Ripley, and in the presentation of images of the mother. This paper considers two further extensions of the image of the mother in these films: its connections to narrative and to mourning. The opening scenes of the first film thematize the connection between motherhood and narrative. But whereas the first two films are dominated by their narrative drive, the third film is more a meditation on guilt and mourning. Drawing on Jacques Derrida's treatment of mourning, this essay presents a reading of Alien 3 which suggests that the guilt Ripley feels as a 'sole survivor' is incorporated as the 'alien' inside her. The closing scenes of the film finally resolve, in an ironic mode, motifs that have been central to the wholes series.

AB  - Hyperreality occurs in a culture when that culture loses the distinction between image and thing, appearance and reality. By reifying the image, the hyperreal culture opens a new level in ontology midway between textual reality and object reality. The difference between original and copy, thing and mirror image collapses, so that all stand at the same ontological level. In this way, a culture has 'More,' viz. that added bit of hype-turned-sense-impression that is blended into the original mixture to create a new experience. The colors on color TV are more colorful than in real life, as the fake desert at Disneyland is more desert-like. Women and men in magazines are more beautiful than real people, and a pinch of monosodium glutamate brings out the flavor in every meal. There are two strategies for creating hyperreal cultures. The first is 'apophatic,' a term borrowed from Medieval mysticism, meaning 'The Negative Way.' In this strategy, the real world is deconstructed into mirror images, its reality undercut. This is the way used by Borges and Lem, Borges by associating the world with mirror images, Lem by constructing a 'carousel' form of reasoning, whereby each argument leads to its opposite, and then leads back again to the original premise. The second strategy is 'cataphatic,' or 'The Positive Way,' which raises the sensory order of appearance until it approaches that of the default, real world. Here, more and more of the real world is assimilated into the simulation, reproduced in the reproduction, until the two versions of the world approach one another asymptotically. This is the strategy employed by the creators of Virtual Reality technology. The real world gradually becomes indistinguishable from the simulacra. Hyperreal cultures are produced by both of these 'ways.' Gradually, image and reality mix, until a new kind of reality is produced.

AB  - Interactive fictions, particularly computer-simulation games, engage the user as a co-creator of a fictional world. Recognizing that the interactive freedom he or she experiences even in the most complex of interactive fictions is a mirage, the user can become keenly aware of the teleology inherent in all fictional works. At their best, however, these interactive fictions are less like novels and more like children's games of make-believe in which objects and stories serve as props in an intensely creative world-building environment or as extensions of real life with gamelike qualities. The burgeoning technology of Virtual Reality serves as an environment conducive to the creation of interactive fictions, but while VR is still in development, hybrids of textual interactive fiction and cyberspace-MUDs-are currently available on Internet. As discussion nodes configured as physical spaces, MUDs foreground the possibility for interactive environments in which creativity is constrained not by available tools but by selected rules, and in which computers are not artificial intelligences (AIs) but intelligence amplifiers (IAs).

The depiction of the ideal woman as a robot whose personality has been formed by exposure to soap operas hardly accords with contemporary ideas, but del Rey's story is subject to attack on such grounds only if one accepts that the story presents Helen as a serious ideal, one to be desired by the reader as well as by the emotionally-arrested men who idolize her in the story (the narrator clearly acknowledges his adolescence of taste); such a reading misses the ironic nuances of the tale. 'Helen O'Loy,' a satire on male fantasies, is far from the 'classic of sexist SF' it has been called by Peter Nicholls.

Just as the work is indebted to the likes of Robinson Crusoe, Gulliver's Travels (especially), Frankenstein, and Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, so it is susceptible to a wide variety of readings, more or less correlative to the diversity of generic contexts that it suggests: adventure-story, utopian fiction, mythical narrative, etc. Moreover, it calls for situation with regard not only to literary tradition(s) but to history-specifically to the ongoing imperialist enterprise of 'civilizing' 'inferior' races. Indeed, it may be that historical connection which best puts in relief Moreau as a farcical tragedy.

AB  - Alien-encounter SF involves the introduction of sentient alien beings into the actantial system of the fictional universe; one or more of the actants are nonhuman or superhuman or subhuman. By staging a confrontation between an alien actant and a terran representative, alien-encounter SF broaches the question of Self and the Other. The reader recuperates this fiction by comparing human and alien entities, measuring the Self by examining the Other. Alien encounters can be discriminated according to the extent to which the alien actant adheres to or departs from anthropocentric norms; in simple terms, we can distinguish between 'human aliens' and 'alien aliens.' This article examines the nature of human aliens by analyzing Orson Scott Card's Ender trilogy, a work which theorizes and surveys possible sets of relations between terran and alien actants. It explores the problematics of alien aliens by looking at appropriate texts by Lem, Benford, and Clarke.

AB  - New manuscript evidence reveals that Olaf Stapledon's 1944 novel 'Sirius' was censored by editors worried about anatomical explicitness and moral subversion in the attraction between an intelligent dog and his human 'sister.' However, in the two-year process of revising 'Sirius' to avoid charges of obscenity, Stapledon managed to keep intact the central narrative situation, deepening its psychological import and sharpening its satirical bite. As he rewrote the book, he continued to draw on his own 'tangled relationship' in an extramarital affair as the immediate inspiration for a novel he described, with an accuracy never full grasped by his readers, as 'a fantasy of love and discord.' In 'Sirius' Stapledon managed, at once, to pacify the censors, disguise the real-life models and anxieties which underlay the novel's creation, and transfigure an unsuccessful private love into a work of art that charts the spiritual landscape of loneliness and interrogates our definition of humanity.

AB  - Though cyberpunk's proponents embrace it as a subversion of corporate culture, its images suggest exactly the opposite. In the work of William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, most particularly Neuromancer and The Artificial Kid, two specific sorts of tropes inform the narrative-a neat reversal of the natural/artificial opposition and an erasure implied by that reversal: advanced technology erases human morality. The rhetorical figures in each of the novels turn on an appropriation of theology; the moral and corporeal are replaced by the mordant and the corporate: Logos is replaced by logo, an affirmation of great corporate houses that ushers in the inconsequence of individual will. Despite otherwise brilliant innovations, cyberpunk is most notable for its tropological evasions of ethical questions, its 'virtual morality.' If only it were parody.

AB  - Despite critical neglect, Canadian SF has produced some interesting texts. Among these is F.P. Grove's Consider Her Ways (1947), which I analyze in conjunction with its main conceptual antecedent in Grove's opus, The Master of the Mill (1944). Grove in both quilts together pastoralism, utopianism, and Darwinism in a peculiar ideological synthesis conducing to an utterly bleak (albeit apparently ludic) vision. In The Master a Naturalist framework sustains a meta-utopian morality play: Grove here reads Canadian history as the outcome of the failure of a whole series of utopian projects. This novel in effect denounces the possibility of human agency within history as inherently (self-) destructive: homo sapiens, as homo faber, has divorced itself from the processes of Nature. In consequence, no utopian enterprise is to be expected from within our species-not even from women, who to Grove's way of thinking are more 'ahistorical,' more 'natural,' than men. The myrmecological utopia of Consider (which is logically as well as chronologically Grove's last work) anticipates the solution of much subsequent SF: the non-human society provides a secular escape from history. Utopia is at once affirmed and denied: founded on a literalization of the term 'body politic,' the pastoral ant society, with its telepathic mass-consciousness and its biological castes, is 'naturally' free from the pitfalls of 'culture'; but its biological basis makes it-and, indeed, any utopian horizon-unachievable for humans. Ambivalently and disturbingly, utopianism and nihilism in Consider become two sides of the same coin, and Grove can conceive of a movement toward Otherness only as a movement away from History.

AB  - J.G. Ballard's vehement general attack on postmodern criticism of science fiction in a recent issue of SFS seems curiously unmotivated. However, it might perhaps be explained by Ballard's anger at Jean Baudrillard's misreading of Ballard's novel 'Crash', mitigated by Ballard's admiration for Baudrillard's other writings.

AB  - By means of editorial comments and reprints of older works in Amazing Stories and other magazines, Hugo Gernsback was the first to present something resembling a history of SF. The earlier works he chose supposedly fit his naïve formula: a narrative incorporating scientific explanations and describing an imaginary but scientifically logical new invention or breakthrough. Gernsback saw the time before 1800 as a long period of relative inactivity, when potential authors of SF (Leonardo da Vinci, Roger Bacon) were hampered by the lack of a supportive environment and appropriate medium. Next, in the 19th century, several prescient writers (Poe, Verne, Wells, and others) emerged who dealt imaginatively with science in their works. Third, in the 20th century, the increased impact of science and a growing awareness of SF-the latter in part inspired by Gernsback himself-greatly enlarged the field and would eventually lead to even greater achievements. In letters to Amazing Stories, readers responded enthusiastically to Gernsback's history of SF, adopted its parameters, and added new authors. Gernsback's version of SF history also may have influenced, and is somewhat parallel to, later academic histories, with some noteworthy differences. Unfortunately, Gernsback's unfair payment policies tended to alienate writers, contributing to the demise of his SF magazines, harming his reputation, and obscuring his own importance in the history of SF.

AB  - In contrast to SF literature, most SF films have responded negatively to technology, seeing it as a force in contemporary society that has had a deleterious effect on the quality of human life. Herbert Marcuse and Jacques Ellul, two of the most pessimistic analysts, have expressed their criticisms of technology in ways that also find expression in some of these films, which are preoccupied with many of the same issues. Three in particular-Forbidden Planet (1956), Colossus: The Forbin Project (1969), and Alien (1979)-can be seen as responses to the theorists in question. In each case the films adopt positions that, while sympathetic with many aspects of Marcuse's indictment of technology, challenge his belief that this technology could ever be a vehicle for human liberation. In contrast, they assume positions closer to that of Ellul, who sees technology's effect on the quality of human life as thoroughly debilitating.

AB  - This essay examines the complex relationship between the many plots and themes of 'Dune' and the history of the Imperium as created by Frank Herbert in the novel. Also, the 'Vitality struggle' is put forth as a major theme of the book, as it is an omnipresent and fundamental conflict which significantly shapes the actions and ideas of 'Dune', and is itself determined by the very Imperial history that created it. The Vitality struggle, which involves a difference in degree rather than in methodology, is the subtle contest between the philosophy of the Empire and that of Arrakis. Paul Muad'Dib is thus a historically spawned and highly influential catalyst who sparks the inertial forces of history into motion, and, as such, is completely intertwined with the existent Imperial structures which enable his rise to godhood.

AB  - 'The White Plague' de Frank Herbert est considéré comme l'un des romans les moins remarquables de son oeuvre; critique que ce conte de la vengeance et de la guerre génétique ne mérite pas. La raison pour laquelle ce roman a été largement délaissé réside dans le fait que la plus grande partie de son contenu reste étrangère au lecteur. J'avance qu'Herbert a inséré plusieurs allusions à l'histoire irlandaise et à la mythologie celtique afin de nous éloigner de l'Irlande qu'il décrit et plus particulièrement de l'idéologie réactionnaire de l'Armée de Libération Irlandaise. Il démontre de trois manières la persistance d'icones et d'événements archaïques dans les politiques nationalistes: il y a de fréquentes allusions à l'histoire militaire irlandaise; il décrit l'adaptation des personages à leur nouveau monde en ressuscitant d'anciennes traditions gaéliques; en dernier lieu, se référant subtilement aussi bien qu'ouvertement à des mythes connus comme les Cycles Mythologiques, il illustre la perception cyclique du temps et de l'histoire, perception traditionnelle des Celtes. En mettant l'accent sur l'influence puissante des mythes sur nos psychismes nationaux et individuels et en démontrant la facilité irréfléchie avec laquelle nous transposons des situations quotidiennes en événements de dimension mythique, il nous avertit que les conflits politiques actuels ne trouveront pas de solutions tant que les idéologues concernés espèrent une issue mythique ou magique à leur combat. /// 'The White Plague' is usually regarded, especially in the critical arena, as one of the least significant of Frank Herbert's novels. This is an undeserved fate, given the quality of this superbly crafted thriller of revenge and genetic warfare. It may be that the novel has been overlooked because so much of its subtextual material is unfamiliar to many readers. I argue here that Herbert inserted numerous allusions to Irish history and Celtic mythology so as to distance readers from the Ireland he portrays, and particularly from the reactionary ideology of the IRA. Herbert demonstrates the persistence of archaic icons and events in Irish nationalist politics in three ways: he makes frequent allusions to Irish military history; he shows his characters coping with their new world by reviving ancient Gaelic customs; and he comments on the traditional Celtic perception of time and history as cyclical through subtle covert and overt references to the collections of myths known as the Cycles. In choosing a mythological system unfamiliar to most readers, Herbert alienates us from the motives and ideals of the characters whose moral and cultural codes are founded upon it. Furthermore, by stressing the powerful influence of inherited myths upon personal and national psyches, and by demonstrating the unthinking ease with which human beings translate daily situations into events of mythic import. he warns us that ongoing political conflicts will not be resolved so long as the ideologues involved expect a mythical or magical climax to their struggles.

Davray. The date of Devray's L'Ile du Docteur 'Moreau' proves that Wells's revamping of the book antedates 1900. To make the case stranger, Davray later averred that Wells intended his revisions to be incorporated in future English-language editions.

AB  - Hailed by its authors, many of its critics, and its promoters within the SF publishing industry as 'preparing the ground for a revolution,' the cyberpunk SF of the 1980s has made large political claims for itself. Some of those claims are implicit in the determination of cyberpunk's authors to legitimize their revolutionary status through establishing a filial link with the SF fathers of the 1960s. But in making such connections, writers like Bruce Sterling have avoided (inadvertently?) all references to the political SF of the '70s, realized in the writings of feminists like Joanna Russ, Ursula Le Guin, Suzy McKee Charnas, and others. Sterling, for example, maintains that SF was in 'hibernation' in the 1970s. Such a pronounced lacuna is provocative, not only for what it reveals about the political space cyberpunk sees itself as occupying, but also for what it suggests with regard to its gender politics. This paper examines the nature of that supposedly revolutionary agenda in cyberpunk, first placing it within the context of its immediate feminist antecedents, then raising a number of questions as to its peculiar reliance on specific cultural icons popular in the Reaganite America of the 1980s.

AB  - Stanislaw Lem's 'Solaris' vividly embodies the problems surrounding the semantic status of fantastic utterances. It poses the problems as two related questions: what is the 'objective' meaning of the notion of the Solarian ocean for the Solarist researchers in the novel, and what is the 'symbolic' meaning of the novel's fantastic ocean for its readers. Since the diegetic planet Solaris has no objective relation to the meaning-producing dynamics of human work, the Solarian ocean is a projection of familiar human meanings. As for the fantastic ocean represented for the reader, it can be approached via several semantic interpretations, none of which are fully adequate. Three such approaches are the plasmatic, i.e., the different descriptions of the ocean are instances of the dominant metasemic lexeme 'plasma'; the vaginal, i.e., the ocean is a displaced image of female sexuality; and the schizophrenic, i.e., the ocean is an instance of a schizophrenic 'miraculation-machine' (derived from Deleuze-Guattari's Anti-Oedipus).

AB  - Dans les textes portant sur l'imaginaire, la question de l'intelligence artificielle renouvelle le problème de la connaissance humaine. Les androïdes, la cybernétique, et les robots nous poussent à nous demander si les machines peuvent manifester la connaissance et si nous pourrions, un jour, être remplacés par nos créations technologiques. En même temps, ils nous forcent à considérer si, nous-mêmes, nous sommes programmés-produits de certaines forces culturelles. Comme dans la plupart de ses oeuvres, 'Le Masque' de Stanislaw Lem pose ces questions, mais ce récit ajoute encore une autre dimension à l'exploration de la connaissance humaine: celle du genre. Dans ce récit, Lem assume la perspective d'un robot qui prend d'abord la forme d'une belle femme, et puis se métamorphose en un insecte métallique. Ce simulacre de femme permet à l'auteur d'analyser le problème de la programmation du genre, et la nature non-humaine du robot lui permet ensuite d'examiner la condition humaine. Dans cet essai, je discute comment 'Le Masque' sert de voie fictive à l'exploration de la notion de sujet (à la Lacan et Foucault). L'expérience du robot à l'égard de l'altérité du langage réflète, selon Lacan, celle de tout sujet humain. De plus, l'accent mis sur le désir sexuel comme lieu des liens du pouvoir soutient la thèse de Foucault sur le rapport entre désir et pouvoir. Je démontre aussi que Lem-tout comme Lacan et Foucault-semble élider la question d'un sujet intrinsèquement féminin, malgré les tentatives de donner un sexe au robot. L'exploration de la condition humaine que tente Lem est donc partiale à une norme masculine parce que la femme artificielle finit par être classée sous une rubrique d'intelligence artificielle générale. En effet, 'Le Masque' se joue dans un théâtre du masculin et du neutre. Ainsi la critique que fait Lem fait partie d'une idéologie qu'il nous faut critiquer. L'histoire ne peut manquer de succomber aux textes idéologiques qui masquent leurs idéologies. Néanmoins, grâce à sa remise en question de la nature programmée du genre et de la sexualité, son gommage du binarisme traditionnel, sa subversion des textes 'à autorité,' et son refus de clôture narrative, 'Le Masque' attaque quand même les structures du pouvoir qui donnent naissance à toutes les formes de programmation culturelle. /// In fictional texts, the issue of artificial intelligence has brought to the fore the question of human consciousness. Androids, cyborgs, and robots prompt us to ask whether machines could manifest consciousness and whether we could in fact be replaced by our creations. At the same time, they force us to consider whether we are ourselves programmed-products of cultural forces, manifestations of the discourse that inscribes us. Like much of his fiction, Stanislaw Lem's 'The Mask' addresses these issues, but it also adds another dimension to the exploration of consciousness-that of gender. In the story, Lem assumes the persona of a robot who initially wears the form of a beautiful human female and then metamorphoses into a metallic bug-like form. The artificiality of the woman enables Lem to examine the issue of gender programming, and the non-human nature of the robot enables him to examine the human condition. My focus is on the way in which Lem's story serves as a site for exploring Lacanian and Foucauldian notions of the subject. The robot's experience of otherness of language mirrors that of the human subject according to Lacanian thought. The story's foregrounding of sexual desire as a locus of power relations affirms the Foucauldian argument of the way in which power and desire are conjoined. I also point out that, despite his attempt to gender the robot, Lem, like Lacan and Foucault, essentially elides the question of an intrinsically female subject. Lem's examination of the human condition is skewed toward a male norm, for the artificial woman ends up being subsumed under a rubric of artificial intelligence in general. In effect, 'The Mask' is played out in a narrative field of the male and the neuter; Lem's critique itself is thus being ensconced in an ideology that we must subject to critique. The story cannot resist succumbing to the ideological narratives that mask their ideology. Nevertheless, through its interrogation of the programmed nature of gender and sexuality, its erasure of traditional binaries, its subversion of authoritarian texts, and its thwarting of narrative closure, it makes a sustained assault upon the power structures that give rise to all forms of cultural programming.

AB  - Dans sa fiction spéculative, Stanislaw Lem explore les frontières entre l'esprit et le cerveau en créant des voies alternatives à la conscience. Lem prend comme modèles d'autres systèmes, inorganiques, de la conscience; et on peut tirer quelque chose de la cohérence de ces modèles en analysant leur structure à l'aide des théories épistèmologiques contemporaines. Dans cet essai, j'offre une analyse structurale des intelligences inorganiques de l'auteur à partir des théories hiérarchiques du temps postulées par J.T. Fraser. Ce schéma cosmologique de l'intelligence comme émergence noétienne du niveau biologique nous fournit une sorte de miroir pour contempler notre propre image, à l'instar de nombreux protagonistes humains qui, dans les fictions de Lem, tombent inévitablement sur leurs propres reflets. Les systèmes inorganiques que j'explore dans cet essai comprennent cette intelligence de plasma occupant toute une planète dans Solaris ainsi que ces synsèctes d'une évolution sythétique dont les ensembles se manifestent sous deux formes: l'arme du Jugement Dernier de la course frénétique aux armements dans la mome 'Upside-Down Evolution' et le 'nuage noir' fatal du texte The Invincible. /// In his speculative fiction, Stanislaw Lem explores the boundaries between mind and brain by fabricating alternative paths to consciousness. Lem models other, inorganic, systems of consciousness; we can learn from the coherence of these models by analyzing their structure using current epistemological theories. In this paper, I report on a structural analysis of Lem's inorganic intelligences based on J.T. Fraser's hierarchical theory of time. This cosmological scheme of intelligence as noetic emergence from a 'biological' level offers us a mirror with which to view our own image, just as many of Lem's human protagonists invariably stumble across mirrored reflections of themselves. The inorganic systems I explore include the planet-wide plasma intelligence in Solaris and the synthetically evolved synsects, aggregates of which can be found in two manifestations: the doomsday weapon of the runaway arms race in the bleak 'Upside-Down Evolution' and the deadly 'black cloud' in The Invincible.

AB  - Cyberpunk est d'une manière agressive un genre chic de SF qui peint l'ère de l'information comme fort dystopique sans jamais en contredire l'ascendence. Ceci est en partie attribuable au fait que le cyberpunk souffre des aspirations ternies de sa propre époque où la haute technologie se trouve contrevalancée par des expectatives diminuées, époque où toute productivité se trouve en contraste avec la stagnation courante. Il y a pourtant des raisons encore plus subtiles. De nouvelles formes culturelles sont particulièrement sensibles à la contingence historique de plusieurs pratiques signifiantes. Né dans le contexte d'un capitalisme avancé, cyberpunk est atrophié par le processus social dont il s'inspire; processus social qui sépare pensée et producteur et vend celle-ci comme marchandise. Le cyberpunk le plus sinistre est hanté par un soupçon: l'information n'est pas simplement la forme sociale et moyenne du savoir, mais plutôt la forme adoptée par le capital dans l'environnement signifiant. Cette différence de sens entre marchandise 'humaine' et instrument de production est exactement le lieu où l'information peut devenir un concept critique. De plus, je propose que ce lieu est le terrain fondamental de cyberpunk parce que c'est ici qu'il rencontre des barrières qu'il ne peut surmonter; ou, plus précisément, il ne peut surmonter ces barrières sans s'anéantir comme genre littéraire. /// Cyberpunk is an aggressively stylish form of SF which puts a hard dystopian spin on the information age without ever disputing its ascendance. Part of this is due to the fact that cyberpunk suffers from the dimmed aspirations of its own era, a time when high technology is counterbalanced by lowered expectations, when any sort of productivity is set off against a prevailing stagnation. There are, however, more subtle motives. New forms of culture are particularly sensitive to the historical contingency of various signifying practices. Emerging as it does in the context of late capitalism, cyberpunk is both inspired and stunted by the social process which enables thought to be alienated from its producer and exchanged as a commodity. The grimmest cyberpunk is haunted by the suspicion that information is not merely the socially average form of knowledge, but rather the form taken by capital in the signifying environment. This difference, between meaning as a 'humane' consumer good and as a cold instrument of production, is precisely the site where information can become a critical concept. It is also, I would suggest, the fundamental terrain of cyberpunk, for here it endlessly encounters barriers that it cannot burst asunder. Or ore accurately, it cannot overcome those barriers without annihilating itself as a literary genre.

AB  - Dans deux pièces peu connues, l'auteur de Crowds and Power explore la possibilité de création d'une utopie grâce aux lois et aux institutions sociales qui dépendent du conformisme volontaire de l'individu. La conclusion de chacun de ces drames met en évidence l'opinion de l'auteur à savoir qu'un tel conformisme reste trop faible pour l'emporter sur les désirs et les besoins de l'individu quand ceux-ci se trouvent en conflit avec la structure sociale. Comedy of Vanity (1933-34) peint une société qui a banni toute forme de culte de l'image, y compris les miroirs, les tableaux, etc. Par conséquent et au détriment de la société entière, les citoyens deviennent de plus en plus obsédés par tout ce qu'ils ne peuvent pas avoir. Dans The Numbered (1956), on fait croire aux citoyens que leur société peut contrôler le moment même de la mort. Au lieu d'éliminer l'incertitude, cela mène à un système de classes sociales où ceux qui ont une existence de courte durée deviennent jaloux de ceux qui ont des vies plus longues et où, de plus, ceux-ci commencent à exploiter ceux-là. Dans le contexte d'autres oeuvres dystopiques telles que Brave New World, We, et 1984, les conclusions de ces deux pièces sont fort intéressantes puisqu'elles soutiennent la notion que le seul moyen d'établir une utopie consiste à encourager les citoyens à croire qu'ils sont déjà heureux. /// In two little-known plays, the author of Crowds and Power explores the possibility of achieving utopia through laws and/or social institutions which depend upon the individual's willingness to conform. The outcome of each drama indicates Canetti's belief that such conformity is too weak to overcome those individual desires and needs which come into conflict with the social structure. Comedy of Vanity (1933-34) depicts a society which has banned mirrors, pictures, and all forms of image worship. As a result, people become obsessed with what they cannot have, to the detriment of society as a whole. In The Numbered (1956), citizens are led to believe that their society controls the moment of death. Rather than eliminating uncertainty, however, this leads to the creation of a class system in which the short-lived are jealous of the long-lived, and in which the latter exploit the former. The resolutions of these plays are especially interesting in the light of such dystopian fictions as Brave New World, We, and 1984, since they demonstrate the position that the only way to achieve utopia is to encourage citizens to believe that they are already happy.

AB  - Le cas de la SF roumaine offre un aperçu fascinant sur l'impact de la pensée scientifique moderne sur une littérature non-occidentale; littérature peu connue en train d'apparaître dans un pays principalement agricole de l'Europe de l'Est caché pendant des décennies derrière le Rideau de Fer. Comme dans d'autres pays européens, la tradition de la SF roumaine est née de ses précurseurs utopiques au dix-neuvième siècle. Le genre, populaire parmi un public assez petit mais fidèle, s'est développé progressivement au vingtième siècle en dépit de deux guerres mondiales et l'oppression du peuple roumain par un gouvernement staliniste. La caractère de ce développement, pourtant, est unique non seulement à la nation roumaine mais, dans une certaine mesure, à tous les pays de l'Europe de l'Est. Les conditions d'édition exigeaient que la SF roumaine soit articulée à travers la nouvelle plutôt que le roman. A cause de la rareté des traductions de la SF occidentale en Roumanie avant 1970-résultat de son isolement forcé ainsi que du contrôle gouvernemental des éditions-le genre s'est développé plus ou moins indépendamment des influences de l'Ouest. Il reste toujours inséparable de la littérature fantastique: en fait, la SF en Roumanie est connue à la fois sous les noms de 'anticipatieri romanesti' (roman d'anticipation) ou 'povestiri stiintifico-fantastice' (histoire de fantaisie scientifique). Un examen de 350 oeuvres de la SF roumanienne écrites entre les années soixante et les années quatre-vingt révèle que 62% d'entre elles prennent la Terre pour cadre (plutôt qu'ailleurs dans l'univers), et que leur contenu réflète des variations de la même thématique: la lutte de l'humanité pour accepter les limites naturelles et les limites de l'existence humaine. Cet essai cherche à présenter aux critiques occidentaux de la SF certains aspects fondamentaux de la tradition de la SF roumaine, tradition née dans un état socialiste rigoureusement centralisé et qui favorisait le développement scientifique et industriel aux dépens du libre examen et du contact avec l'Ouest. /// The case of Romanian SF offers a fascinating glimpse into the impact that modern scientific thought has had on a little known non-Western literature emerging from a predominantly agricultural East European country buried for decades behind the Iron Curtain. As in other European nations, the tradition of Romanian SF emerged in the 19th century from utopian precursors. The genre enjoyed a small but loyal following and developed steadily throughout the 20th century despite Romania's unhappy involvement in the world wars and brutal oppression under a Stalinist-style communism. The path of this development, however, is unique to the nation and, to some extent, in the Eastern bloc as well. Circumstances of publication demanded that Romanian SF be carried through the short story rather than the novel. Because few works of Western SF were translated before the 1970s, partly as a consequence of Romania's forced isolation and state control of publishing, the genre developed independently of Western influences for the most part. It remains inseparable from the larger body of fantastic literature, the Romanian title for SF actually being alternately 'anticipatieri romanesti' (romance of anticipation) or 'povestiri stiintifico-fantastice' (science-fantasy story). A survey of 350 Romanian SF works written between the 1960s and 1980s revealed that fully 62% are set on Earth rather than elsewhere in the cosmos, their content reflecting variations on a single central theme: humanity's struggle to accept natural limits and limitations on human existence. This paper seeks to acquaint Western scholars with key elements of the Romanian SF tradition as it emerged from a highly centralized socialist state which privileged scientific and industrial development even as it stifled free inquiry and contact with the West.

AB  - Cet essai explique la persistence du mythe qui issue du roman 'Frankenstein' de Mary Shelley comme étant le résultat de sa focalisation thématique primaire sur l'envie d'utérus. Le roman a été largement inspiré par les frustrations procréatrices de l'auteur, et le mythe jouit d'une popularité continuelle depuis presque deux siècles parce qu'il s'adresse principalement aux frustrations subconscientes mâles du même genre. 'Frankenstein' se lit ici dans le contexte de l'oeuvre de Bruno Bettelheim Symbolic Wounds qui, dans sa révision de la théorie psychanalytique traditionnelle, donne à l'envie d'utérus autant d'importance qu'au concept freudien de l'envie de pénis. The Island of Doctor Moreau de Wells est également interprété comme étant un example de la science 'mâle' usurpatrice de la fonction femelle naturelle. L'épistémologie est aussi un thème étroitement apparenté: les deux romans suggèrent que l'origine de toute connaissance provient de la curiosité génitale. Les effets d'épouvante créés dans ces romans trouvent leur origine dans la description de la menace que la science moderne présente aux rôles sexuels traditionnels. /// This essay explains the persistence of the myth deriving from Mary Shelley's novel 'Frankenstein' as the result of its primary thematic focus on womb envy. The novel was largely inspired by the author's procreative frustrations, and the myth has enjoyed such persistent popularity for nearly two centuries because it addresses mainly unconscious male frustrations of the same kind. 'Frankenstein' is read here in the light of Bruno Bettelheim's Symbolic Wounds, which in its revision of psychoanalytic theory gives womb envy equal place with the orthodox Freudian concept of penis envy. Wells's The Island of Doctor Moreau is interpreted as another example of crazed male science usurping a natural female function. Epistemology is a closely related theme in these novels: both suggest that the origin of all learning is rooted in genital curiosity. The horrific effects of both derive from their depictions of the threat posed by modern science to traditional sex roles.

AB  - Les romans The Shore of Women (Pamela Sargent, 1986), A Door into Ocean (Joan Slonczewski, 1986), et The Gate to Women's Country (Sheri Tepper, 1988) peuvent être considérés comme dans un dialogue avec les utopies féministes des années 1970. The Shore of Women, d'abord, nous donne une utopie ratée: une société matriarcale qui domine et exploite les hommes. Ce roman est plutôt un appel à la réconciliation des sexes, mais à travers le récit d'une conversion à l'hétérosexualité, il frôle l'homophobie et l'hétérosexisme. The Gate to Women's Country attire l'attention du lecteur sur les moyens de batir une société nouvelle-en transformant la 'nature humaine,' et en particulier la prédisposition des hommes à la violence. A Door into Ocean, enfin, nous montre des limites à ce que l'on pourrait ou devrait faire pour maintenir une utopie, rejetant ainsi la nécessité des luttes violentes qui informait la plupart des utopies des années 1970. De manières différentes, chacun de ces romans corrige en quelque sorte ce que les auteurs ont vu d'excessif dans les utopies précédentes. Mais parfois ils semblent aller trop loin dans l'autre sens, jusqu'à l'abandon des principes féministes. Ce sont pourtant des continuations importantes de la tradition féministe utopique. /// Pamela Sargent's The Shore of Women (1986), Joan Slonczewski's A Door into Ocean (1986), and Sheri Tepper's The Gate to Women's Country (1988) may be read as interlocutors in a dialogue with the feminist utopias of the 1970s. In terms of its setting and plot, Sargent's The Shore of Women portrays a matriarchal society which dominates and exploits men as a failed utopia; and in its appeal for a reconciliation of the sexes it seems to have accommodated both homophobia and heterosexism through the narrative of a conversion to heterosexuality. The Gate to Women's Country shifts the utopian focus away from the contours of the alternative community to the mechanism for achieving the better society-one based on changing 'human nature' and the male predisposition to violence, a problem for which Sargent had no solution. A Door into Ocean, finally, argues forcibly that there are limits to what can or must be done to protect a utopia, rejecting the strategies enunciated in the 1970s by a whole range of utopias which acknowledged the necessity of violence to bring about a new society. In contrast to the utopias of the 1970s, these three novels do not focus on the evocations of alternative societies, but rather blend representations of alternative patterns of life with more rhetorical and figurative evocations of a transformed world. In the manner of the critical utopia, these three novels propose correctives to what their authors saw as some of the excesses of the 1970s utopias. Yet at time these works seem to go too far in their implied critiques of the '70s utopias. The references here to liminality-door, gate, shore-seem to stand not only for a vision of a world on the verge of being born, but as a retreat, the doorway through which the authors are backing away from the utopian hopes and dreams of the '70s-a gesture which to some extent repudiates the earlier utopian energies.

AB  - L'auteur offre une interprétation du roman extraordinaire de Esther Rochon intitulé 'Coquillage' qui le situe dans la tradition des 'histoires de l'île' québecoises et qui le rattache au roman Frankenstein de Mary Shelley. Dans ces deux romans, il s'agit de 'monstres' sympathiques dont les origines proviennent des rêves de la grossesse, de la naissance, et de la mort. Le monstre de Rochon incarne une acceptation à la fois de tout ce qui est merveilleux et de tout ce qui est hideux et dégoutant de la condition humaine. Dans ses 'Notes sur 'Coquillage',' Rochon explique les détails de la génèse et la composition de son oeuvre, y compris une première version intitulée 'Mourir une fois pour toutes' et toutes les difficultés qu'elle a eues à transformer cette nouvelle en roman. Dans cet essai, elle discute également les influences sur 'Coquillage' du buddhisme tibetien et de la géographie du Québec ainsi que les rapports entre la chronologie des évenements dans 'Coquillage' et sa forme narrative réarrangée. /// David Ketterer offers an interpretation of Esther Rochon's extraordinary novel 'The Shell' which places it in the tradition of Québécois 'island stories' and relates it to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Both works feature sympathetic 'monsters' and originated in dreams related to pregnancy, birth, and death. Rochon's monster, it is argued, embodies an acceptance of all that is wonderful and all that is hideous and disgusting about the human condition. Esther Rochon, in her 'Notes on 'Coquillage',' elaborates on the genesis and process of composition of 'The Shell', including a first version entitled 'Mourir une fois pour toutes' (To Die Once and For All) and various problems that arose in transforming this short story into a novel. She also discusses the influence on 'The Shell' of both Tibetan Buddhism and the geography of Québec, as well as the relationship between the chronology of events in 'The Shell' and its rearranged narrative form.

AB  - Le nouveau paradigme scientifique du chaos déterministe-qui explique comment des systèmes complexes et apparament chaotiques se transforme subitement en de nouveaux registres de complexité-entretient un rapport particulièrement fascinant avec la SF. Le modèle de chaos proposé par Ilya Prigogine, des 'structures dissipatives,' explique comment un système ouvert, sous certaines conditions physiques, tend à se réorganiser spontanément à un niveau plus haut de complexité, ainsi résolvant les différences fondamentales entre l'évolution et l'entropie et entre les tendances vers la simplicité ou vers la complexité dans les descriptions scientifiques de la réalité. Certains écrivains américains postmodernes de la SF se servent des théories de Prigogine à la fois comme sujets explicites et comme un nouveau discours qui porte la SF à un niveau plus élevé de mérite artistique. Dans son roman Radix (1981), A.A. Attanasio incorpore les idées de Prigogine dans son portrait de l'auto-évolution d'une intelligence artificielle. Lewis Shiner, dans son Deserted Cities of the Heart construit son roman comme un portrait des déséquilibres complexes de l'espace-temps historique qui sont implicites dans les théories du chaos. Bruce Sterling dans ses fictions de 'Mech-and-Shaper'-The Cicada Queen et Schismatrix-évoque les complexités d'un univers 'post-humain' où des boucles de feed-back de plus en plus élaborés entre la technologie et la culture humaine finissent par créer des conditions tout à fait imprévisibles. Et dans The Difference Engine (1990), Sterling et William Gibson appliquent ces théories à un autre mode du genre SF: l'histoire alternative. /// The new scientific paradigm of deterministic chaos, which explains how complex, apparently chaotic systems leap into new orders of complexity, has an especially intriguing relationship with SF. The chaos model of Ilya Prigogine, called dissipative structures, explains how an open system under certain physical conditions will spontaneously organize itself at a higher level of complexity; it thus resolves apparently fundamental contradictions between evolution and entropy, and between the impulses to simplicity and complexity in scientific descriptions of reality. A group of postmodern American SF writers use Prigogine's theories both as explicit subjects, and as a new discourse that raises the standards of SF as an art form. In his Radix (1981), A.A. Attanasio applies Prigoginian ideas to depict the auto-evolution of a machine intelligence. Lewis Shiner, in his Deserted Cities of the Heart (1988), constructs his novel as a depiction of the complex destabilizations of historical time and space implied in Chaos Theory. Bruce Sterling, in his Mech-and-Shaper fictions-The Cicada Queen and Schismatrix-constructs ever more complicated feedback loops between technology and human culture create unpredictable new conditions. In The Difference Engine (1990), Sterling and William Gibson apply chaotic systems theory to the alternate history mode of SF.

AB  - Un principe central des définitions du postmodernisme est l'effacement de la frontiére entre la soi-disant 'haute' et 'basse' culture. On prétend que des formes autrefois autonomes et différenciées tendent maintenant à se mêler et à s'embrouiller-caractéristique associée à un modernisme dépassé. De telles affirmations sembleraient offrir aux critiques de la SF la possibilité d'échapper aux limitations d'arguments tels que 'canon' ou 'ghetto' littéraires, ou d'autres termes équivalents. Pourtaut, si l'on examine de près ce que disent certains critiques postmodernes qui traitent la SF, on découvre qu'en dépit de ce gommage, il y a toujours une réinscription de la frontière. Il ne s'agit pas, en fin de compte, d'effacer les démarcations mais plutôt de maintenir une vigilance constante en ce qui concerne le fonctionnement des frontières dans la production de valeurs tout en s'interrogeant sur la possibilité de distinguer d'un côté ce processus et de l'autre l'acceptance de frontières nécessaires à laè formulation d'un discours significatif sur le genre de la SF. /// A central tenet of definitions of postmodernism is the erasure of the border between so-called 'high' and 'low' culture. There is now, it is claimed, an intermixing and blurring of previously autonomous and differentiated forms, a distinction associated with a superseded modernism. Such claims would appear to present SF critics with the potential to escape the constrictions of arguing in terms of the 'mainstream' and the 'ghetto,' or equivalent terms. Looking in detail at a number of postmodernist critics who explicitly deal with SF reveals, however, that whilst there are overt claims of erasure, there is always an ultimate reinscription of the border. It is not a question of erasing borders, but of a constant vigilance and self-awareness as to how borders operate in the production of value, and whether it is possible to separate this process from that of the necessity of borders in producing meaningful statements about the genre of SF.

AB  - Au croisement de la cybernétique et de la phénomèologie, le corps agit déjà comme interface entre l'esprit et l'expérience, mais dans les récits de SF et d'épouvante contemporains, le corps est également site d'exploration et de transfiguration à travers lequel est inscrite une interface avec une expérience postmoderne basée sur électronique. La remise en scène obsessive de la réfiguration du corps énonce une redéfinition continuelle du sujet à travers la superimposition multiple d'appareils biotechniques. A cette époque d'obsolescence humaine, pourtant, une image/imaginaire du corps et du sujet d'une consistence remarquable semble apparaître. Cet essai examine la réfiguration du corps dans les oeuvres suivantes: Limbo de Stelarc, un roman de 1953 de Bernard Wolfe, Crash de J.G. Ballard (1973), et Schismatrix de Bruce Sterling (1985). Schismatrix suggère que 'cyberpunk' constitue un discours où une variété de thèmes et de techniques surréalistes est de nouveau d'actualité-une production technosurréaliste d'une nouvelle chair, une chair 'terminale.' Les narrations cyberpunk parlent vraiment avec les voix du désir et de l'angoisse refoulés face à la culture terninale. Cyberpunk réussit à maintenir une trajectoire complexe et délicate entre les forces de la raison instrumentale et l'abandon d'un excès sacrificiel. Dans sa conclusion, cet essai considère ce que Gilles Deleuze et Félix Guattari appellent 'Le Corps sans organes': un philosophie de transgression corporelle. Dans la fantaisie d'un Corps sans Organes, le corps resiste la finalité de l'organisme, du sujet. Deleuze et Guattari sont, eux aussi, cyberpunks puisqu'ils fabriquent des fictions d'identité terminale avec le langage presque familier d'un certain techno-surréalisme. /// At the intersection of cybernetics and phenomenology, the body already operates as an interface between mind and experience, but in contemporary science fiction and horror, the body is also narrated as a site of exploration and transfiguration through which an interface with an electronically-based postmodern experience is inscribed. The obsessive restaging of the refiguration of the body posits a constant redefinition of the subject through the multiple superimposition of bio-technological apparatuses. In this epoch of human obsolescence, however, a remarkably consistent imaging/imagining of both body and subject ultimately emerges. The essay examines the refiguration of the body in the performance art of Stelarc and in three novels: Bernard Wolfe's Limbo (1953), J.G. Ballard's Crash (1973), and Bruce Sterling's Schismatrix (1985). The examination of Schismatrix suggests that cyberpunk constitutes a discourse within which many concerns and techniques of surrealism again become relevant-a techno-surrealist production of a new flesh: a terminal flesh. The cyberpunk narrations indeed speak with the voices of repressed desire and repressed anxiety about terminal culture. Cyberpunk negotiates a complex and delicate trajectory between the forces of instrumental reason and the abandon of a sacrificial excess. The essay concludes by considering what Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari call 'The Body Without Organs': a philosophy of bodily transgression. In the fantasy of the Body without Organs, the body resists the finality of the organism, of the subject. Deleuze and Guattari are cyberpunks, too, constructing fictions of terminal identity in the nearly familiar language of a techno-surrealism.

AB  - L'oeuvre de P.K. Dick est marquée par un désir profond de défendre l'individualisme libéral ainsi qu'une compréhension des menaces posées à cet individualisme par des êtres nonhumains comme les androïdes et les dieux. Mais les êtres nonhumains sont aussi peints comme étant valables en soi. Le résultat dans la SF de Dick écrite pendant sa période moyenne est une dialectique complexe et une révision étonnante de l'individualisme libéral. Dans ses oeuvres postérieures, cette dialectique devient plus tendue et difficile; l'attrait d'une croyance en un dieu ou en un être surnaturel comme alternative à la réalité sociale acceptée s'en trouve fortifié, mais l'individualité et la différence elle-même en sont compromises. Le résultat, dans 'Valis', est une retraite à la textualité. Cette retraite menace la différence puisque la variété de textes auxquels on se réfère se trouve réduite à un seul (quoique changeant) sens. Cependant l'innovation la plus frappante de 'Valis' est son traitment des rapports entre l'auteur et le lecteur. Je décris ce traitement comme la renaissance de l'auteur. La différence est remise en place parce que le sens des expériences dans 'Valis' se trouve rattaché à Dick lui-même et à Orange County, et ne peut s'en détacher. Mais cette réaffirmation exige un prix coûteux: un sens qui ne peut être capté par le lecteur n'est plus sens du tout. /// P.K. Dick's work is marked by a strong desire to vindicate liberal individualism, and an apprehension of the threat to liberal individualism posed by non-human beings such as androids and deities. But, in contrast, non-human beings are also portrayed as valuable. The result in the SF of Dick's middle period is a complex dialectic and a startling revision of liberal individualism. In his later works, this dialectic becomes more tense and difficult; the appeal of belief in a deity or preternatural being as an alternative to prevailing social reality strengthens, but individuality, and difference itself, are jeopardized. The result, in 'Valis', is best described as a retreat into textuality; this retreat endangers difference, since the variety of texts resorted to is reduced to one (if shifting) meaning. Yet the most striking formal innovation of 'Valis' is its treatment of the relations between author and reader. This is described here as a rebirth of the author. Difference is reasserted because the meaning of the experiences which 'Valis' treats is tied to Dick and Orange County, and cannot be detached from them. But this reassertion is at a severe cost, since meaning that cannot be detached by the reader is hardly meaning at all.

AB  - Dans l'ordre hyperréel des simulacres qui est dirigé par des systèmes de contrôle informatiques et cybernétiques, la réalité est de plus en plus déterminée par des modèles (plutôt que l'inverse). La distance qui sépare la réel (les faits) et l'imaginaire (la fiction) disparaît, et avec elle l'espace discursif traditionnel utilisé par les utopies et la SF classique. La SF ne peut plus fournir un modèle imaginaire du réel parce que celui-ci est déjà, lui-même, un produit des modèles. Le nouveau rôle de la SF est de représenter cet effacement de la distance entre la fiction et les faits. /// In the hyperreal order of simulations, which is governed by informatic and cybernetic control systems, reality is increasingly determined by models (rather than the reverse). The distance deparating the real (fact) and the imaginary (fiction) collapses, and with it the discursive space traditionally used by utopias and classical SF. SF can no longer supply an imaginary model of the real because the latter, itself, is the product of models. SF is now called upon to portray this breakdown of the distance between fiction and fact.

AB  - Cet essai soutient que le protagoniste de l'ouvrage de Sterling est motivé surtout par un désir d'atteindre une totalisation de soi-but qui reste impossible à réaliser à moins de rejeter l'idée du progès technologique et accepter la notion de totalité hégélienne. L'essai examine comment Sterling se sert de la métaphysique hégélienne pour atteindre cette totalisation de soi, et il offre une explication de ce texte dans le cadre du rapport entre les décisions des protagonistes et la philosophie de Hégel. En fin de compte, l'essai soutient que Sterling ne peut fournir qu'une vision formelle de 'l'Absolu' hégélien. /// This article argues that the protagonist of Sterling's work is driven by a desire to achieve wholeness-a goal which cannot be reached until he rejects technological progress and embraces an Hegelian concept of totality. The article analyzes how Sterling employs Hegelian metaphysics as a means to acquiring this wholeness, and explicates the book by demonstrating how the characters' decisions relate to Hegel's philosophy. Ultimately the article claims that Sterling is able to provide only a formal vision of the Hegelian 'Absolute.'

AB  - Avec le temps, Le Guin a modifié sa stratégie narrative en ce qui concerne les diverses évocations des sociétés utopiques. De plus, ces changements sont dus autant à des motifs politiques (y compris le désir de rejecter la pensée euclidienne) qu'à des considérations portant sur les procédés littéraires. En effet, sa préoccupation consciente de rendre l'utopie inhabitable ainsi que de créer un monde fictif où les gens pourraient (et voudraient) vivre rendent compte des variations techniques observées entre The Dispossessed et Always Coming Home. /// In her various representations of utopian societies, Le Guin has over time altered her narrative strategy. Moreover, her shifts in narrative strategy derive as much from political considerations (including a desire to repudiate 'euclidean' thinking) as from any purely about literary technique. Indeed, it is her conscious concern with rendering utopia inhabitable, with creating a fictive world that people can (and would want to) live in, that explains the technical differences between The Dispossessed and Always Coming Home.

AB  - Les oeuvres de Disch ont souvent été qualifiées de sombres et de pessimistes à cause de la prédominance du ton quasi dystopien. Cependant, une analyse générique plus attentive de trois de ses romans, sans doute les plus importants jusqu'à ce jour, Camp Concentration, 334, et On Wings of Song, révèle qu'il renonce à la 'métaphysique' dystopienne, et à son déterminisme inhérent, pour se tourner résolument vers le monde réaliste et neutre de la science-fiction. Certes, sa SF sociale reflète de nombreux sujets analogues à ceux de la dystopie classique. Mais, ainsi que le démontre l'analyse des caractéristiques communes aux paradigmes sociaux dans les trois romans, Disch a une façon unique de fusionner la SF avec les préoccupations sociales dystopiennes que l'on peut qualifier au mieux de fiction 'dischtopienne.' /// Disch's work has often been branded as dark and pessimistic in view of its predominant quasi-dystopian tonality. Yet a careful generic analysis of his three most important novels to date-Camp Concentration, 334, and On Wings of Song-reveals that Disch renounces dystopian 'metaphysicality,' with its inherent determinism, and instead firmly embeds his vision in the realistic, neutral world of SF. To be sure, his social SF does mirror many of the topical concerns of the classical dystopia. But as a consideration of the features common to the social paradigms in all three of his novels demonstrates, he uniquely fuses SF with dystopian social preoccupations in a way that makes for what can best be termed 'Dischtopian' fiction.

AB  - Au cours de l'année dernière, la découverte de certaines lettres de Dick montrent que l'écrivain ne subissait pas uniquement la relation qu'il avait avec le FBI ou qu'il en était entièrement la victime. Pendant une période de six mois ou peu plus, il expédia au FBI au moins 21 de textes dénonciateurs qui témoignent d'une lubie paranoïaque: il se croyait la cible, à l'échelle planétaire, d'une conspiration marxiste qui comprenait un grand nombre d'agents et d'agences parmi lesquelles se serait trouver SFS. Les faits qui caractérisent ce cas peuvent se prêter à plusieurs hypothèses interprétatives soit psycho-analytique ou autres. Deux choses peuvent être avancées en toute certitude concernant cette affaire, d'abord les matériaux qui la constituent, surtout en relation avec les nombreuses interprétations auxquelles on peut se livrer, pourraient contribuer à l'élaboration d'un roman 'à la Dick,' rival de Ubik. L'autre constatation sans équivoque, du moins en apparence, et ce malgré les raisons qui le poussaient à agir, se rapporte à son comportement entièrement réprehensible à la fois parce qu'il illustre le double visage et également à cause des conséquences qu'il pouvait entraîner. /// Within the last year or so, letters of Dick's have become known indicating that his 'relationship' with the FBI was not solely passive on his part, nor chiefly that of victim. Over a span of six months (or more), he sent the FBI at least 21 denunciatory communications detailing a paranoid fantasy of Dick's: that he was a target of a worldwide Marxist conspiracy involving a multitude of agents and agencies, SFS among them. The facts in the case admit of any number of interpretative hypotheses, psychoanalytic and otherwise. Indeed, that the materials, especially in relation to the many interpretations they lend themselves to, make for a Dickian novel to rival Ubik, say, is one of only two things which can be said for certain about this FBI affair. The other is that, to all appearances at least, Dick's behavior (whatever his motives) was utterly reprehensible, and not merely because it was two-faced but also by reason of its (possible) consequences.

AB  - Le héros le plus commun dans la SF est désigné par Gregory Benford comme L'Homme Compétent, dont les capacités sommeillent jusqu'au moment où des circonstances imprévues leur permettent de se manifester. Par contre, la SF de Barry N. Malzberg n'a pas de personnages 'compétents,' c'est-à-dire que les protagonistes chez Malzberg remportent des victoires personnelles limitées-si tant est qu'ils en remportent. Le plus souvent, ces protagonistes sont des héros d'imitation, ou bien des anti-héros. De plus, Malzberg se démarque de la tradition de la SF en ce qui concerne les intrigues typiques (problèmes à résoudre, etc.). Il s'écarte de la SF normale dans la peinture de ses personnages et dans ses intrigues parce qu'il écrit non pas dans la tradition romantique mais dans la tradition satirique. En tant que satires, ses romans mettent en scène des consciences fracturées où les problèmes les plus simples semblent insolubles. Pour Malzberg, la SF devrait explorer à fond les crises émotionnelles et métaphysiques de la vie au vingtième siècle. A cette fin, l'auteur cherche à transformer les tropes et les formules typiques de la SF en métaphores représentant l'exploration de soi. Non seulement ses protagonistes se lancent-ils dans l'introspection (leur statut du 'héros' étant déterminé par la puissance de leurs efforts), mais encore l'introspection s'applique à Malzberg lui-même. Donc, en dépit d'avoir accusé la SF de se prêter à 'l'évasion,' il lui reconnaît le potentiel de fournir des tropes pertinentes grâce auxquelles on commercerait à évaluer les difficultés inhérentes au maintien de l'individualité en face des vicissitudes de l'existence moderne. /// The most frequent SF hero is what Gregory Benford calls the Competent Man, whose abilities lie dormant until unforeseen circumstances allow them to emerge. Barry N. Malzberg's SF has no such figure. Instead, his protagonists attain limited personal victories-when, indeed, they attain any at all. More often they are imitation heroes or anti-heroes. Malzberg also breaks away from the SF tradition of the problem story. The reason that his SF diverges from other SF in character and plot is that he writes not in the Romance tradition but in the Satire tradition of SF. As Satire, his novels show fractured consciousness, and simple problems seem insoluable. For Malzberg, SF ought to explore intensely the emotional and metaphysical crises of life in the 20th century. To do this, he transforms typical SF tropes and devices into metaphors of self-exploration. Not only do his characters embark on self-exploration (their status as 'heroes' being determined by their strength of endeavor), but through his SF Malzberg also explores himself. Thus, despite his criticism of SF's 'escapism,' he sees a potential for SF to provide pertinent tropes by which to begin to assess the difficulties of maintaining individuality against the vicissitudes of modern existence.

AB  - La SF fait face à un problème fondamental: elle s'est alliée à une industrie de l'édition dont la raison d'être est sans rapport et parfois même hostile aux intérêts et aux désirs de la communauté d'écrivains et de lecteurs de la SF. Comme toutes les corporations multinationales postmodernes, l'édition cherche à standardiser ses produits et à gérer créateurs et consommateurs afin de maximiser ses bénéfices. Ecrivains et les éditeurs ont aidé l'industrie à atteindre ces buts en souscrivant à l'idée de 'professionalisation,' une idéologie qui encourage les auteurs à viser les éditeurs et les cadres des grandes maisons d'édition comme public. Puisque pour les 'professionals' le désir de plaire aux patrons est plus important que leur propre imagination créatrice ou leur vision individuelle, il en résulte que les écrivains professionels de la SF s'autocensurent consciemment et inconsciemment afin de s'aligner avec l'idéologique de ces mêmes patrons. Les pressions à se plier à ces exigeances idéologiques ont atteint un tel niveau aujourd'hui que même les auteurs qui s'y opposent consciemment ont du mal à y résister. On conseille vivement à la communauté de SF d'arracher la SF à e'emprise de ces méga-éditeurs et de ces chaînes de maisons d'édition pour satisfaire à la diversité des goûts, chose à laquelle l'industrie de l'édition ne s'intéresse guère. /// SF has a problem: it has linked its fortunes with a publishing industry whose raison d'être is irrelevant (perhaps even inimical) to the interests and desires of the community of SF readers and writers. Like all postmodern multinational corporate sectors (which it has largely become), the publishing industry seeks to standardize its product and efficiently manage its producers and consumers in order to maximize its profits. Writers and editors have assisted the industry in accomplishing these objectives by subscribing to 'professionalism,' an ideology that encourages writers to take editors and bookstore-chain executives rather than readers as their primary audience. Since 'professionals' place pleasing their employers above their own creativity and vision, professional SF writers censor themselves both consciously and unconsciously in order to meet their employers' perception of the ideological bottom line. The pressures on SF writers to toe this ideological bottom line have become so massive that even consciously resisting writers find them difficult to withstand. The SF community is therefore urged to wrest SF's fate from the hands of the megacorporate publishers and bookstore chains so that diverse tastes can be served by diverse books, something the publishing industry has no interest in doing.

AB  - Les articles des quinze premiers volumes de 'Science-Fiction Studies' sont des exemples du genre de travail qui se fait et qui peut se faire dans le domaine de la science-fiction. Beaucoup d'importance est accordée aux questions théoriques qui sont abordées de nombreuses façons. En tant que sujet d'étude, on alloue moins de place à l'Histoire du genre bien qu'on s'applique à traiter de l'origine de la science-fiction et de ses débuts. Cependant, on remarque que l'approche est très variée en ce qui concerne le traitement de l'utopie et la perception des autres médias. Finalement, les articles publiés ont contribué au souhait des directeurs de la revue dont l'objectif principal en 1979 était de parvenir à une 'ouverture critique'. Mais malgré ces visées, de nombreux essais ne traitent que d'un seul auteur (parmi lesquels Ursula Le Guin tient une place prépondérante). Néanmoins, Science-Fiction Studies se remarque par sa portée internationaliste et elle montre que, en ce qui a trait à la critique littéraire et à l'importance académique, l'étude des textes de science-fiction peut se comparer au travail effectué en d'autres secteurs. / The articles in the first 15 volumes of SFS are worth examining as examples of the kind of work that is being done and can be done in the field of SF. There is a decided emphasis on theoretical questions, which are dealt with through a wide variety of approaches. The history of the genre is less prominent as a research topic, though some attention is paid to SF's prehistory and early history. A broadening of perspective becomes most noticeable in the interest in Utopia and the awareness of other media. All in all, the articles in SFS realize the 'critical opening' that the editors in 1979 identified as the journal's principal aim. But in spite of editorial intentions, a great many of the essays in SFS are still concerned with single SF authors (Ursula Le Guin foremost among them). Even so, SFS is striking for its internationalism, and at the same time demonstrates that the study of SF texts can stand comparison with work in other areas in point of its literary-critical and scholarly value.

AB  - La recherche des origines d'un genre est une exploration sans fin. Les sources de la science-fiction peuvent rémontées à Homère ou à Lucien pour les voyages imaginaires, et à Platon et More pour le versant utopique. Mais le voyage imaginaire comme l'utopie demeurent pure fantaisie ou jeu conceptuel non narratif. Avec Le Songe, Kepler inaugure un nouvel espace spéculatif: il expose les conséquences d'une théorie astronomique en articulant des raisonnements analogiques et des calculs vérifiables dans le cadre d'une fiction qui sert d'appui à une polémique philosophique et scientifique. Compte tenu des conditions d'émergence de cette fiction, Kepler se trouve dans l'obligation d'inventer une forme à la fois éclatée (dimension que lui confèrent les notes en annexe) et emboîtée (l'intervention du narrateur surnaturel qui justifie la démarche scientifique). Cette forme très complexe et difficile à lire n'a d'ailleurs eu aucune postérité directe. Cependant, à partir de ce nouvel espace spéculatif inventé par Kepler, Godwin, puis Cyrano de Bergerac (qui ont su intégrer habilement le savoir neuf dans le cadre d'une fiction plus linéaire) développent des situations qui aboutiront à la science-fiction classique. Nous avons donc avec Le Songe un 'primitif' de la science-fiction 'hard' et sans doute le 'chaînon manquant' entre Lucien et More d'un côté et la tradition de la science-fiction de l'autre. /// The search for the origins of a literary genre is an endless exploration. The sources of SF can be traced, in relation to the imaginary voyage, to Homer and Lucian and, for utopian fiction, to Plato and Thomas More. But both imaginary voyages and utopias remain either pure fantasy or non-narrative conceptual games. With Kepler's Somnium, a new speculative format was inaugurated: he demonstrated the consequences of an astronomical theory, complete with analogical reasoning and verifiable mathematics, within the framework of a fiction which served as a kind of polemical platform for his philosophical and scientific arguments. Taking into account the historical conditions prevailing at the time of this work, Kepler was obliged to invent a complex narrative form which was simultaneously open-ended (with its addition of appendicized notes) and multi-framed (with the intervention of a supernatural narrator to render its message credible)-a narrative form that was clumsy, difficult to read, and with no direct posterity. Nevertheless, utilizing this new speculative format invented by Kepler, both Godwin and Cyrano de Bergerac-who more skillfully integrated the 'new' knowledge into their linear narrative models-began to develop its potentialities into the first 'classical' SF. In Kepler's Somnium, therefore, we have the first example of 'hard' SF and what might be called a generic 'missing link' between Lucian and More on the one hand and the SF tradition on the other.

AB  - De bien des façons, 'Swastika Night' est l'équivalent, pour les années 30, du roman Le Maître du Haut Château. Ce qui rapproche Burdekin de Dick plutôt que de Huxley ou d'Orwell se situe surtout dans l'insistance portée à la problématique de l'Histoire et à la reconstruction du passé ainsi que dans la promotion des valeurs qui n'ont pas la même vogue idéologique que 1984 ou Le meilleur des mondes. Cette œuvre fictive 'étrangère' qui annonce La servante écarlate de Margaret Atwood relate un future dans lequel le triomphe du nazisme se manifeste dans la brutalité envers les femmes (aussi bien qu'envers les Juifs) considérées comme une 'race inférieure.' Dans ce contexte, von Hess, Herman et Alfred essayent de réunir les morceaux d'Histoire afin de retrouver la 'vérité' historique déformée par la Nuit du swastika. Mais même Alfred, le plus sympathique de ces héros en puissance, ne réussit pas à assimiler les valeurs que les femmes incarnent, c'est-à-dire le pacifisme et le rejet de la domination qui peuvent mettre un terme à la Nuit de la violence brutale de l'agression masculine. / Swastika Night is in many ways the 1930s' equivalent of 'The Man in the High Castle.' It is not simply Burdekin's focus on the problematics of history, of reconstructing the past, that brings her closer to Dick than to Huxley and Orwell, but also her promotion of values which still do not have the ideological currency of 1984's or Brave New World's. This estranged fiction of hers anticipates Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale in its depiction of a future wherein the triumph of Nazism has meant the brutalization of women (as well as Jews) for being an 'inferior race.' It is in that context that von Hess, Herman, and Alfred attempt to piece together the fragments of history and thereby recover the historical 'truth' that the Night of the Swastika would deform. Yet even Alfred, the most sympathetic of these (would-be) 'heroes,' sadly fails to make the values that women represent integral to himself-the values of pacificism and non-domination that alone promise a possible end to the Night of the brutal violence of male aggression.

AB  - La science-fiction américaine a contribué à modeler et à structurer la guerre que les Etats-Unis ont menée en Indochine; en contrepartie, cette guerre a profondément refaçonné cette même science-fiction. En effet, la guerre du Viet-Nam peut être mieux comprise si elle est perçue comme étant une forme américaine de science-fiction et de fantaisie. Les romans populaires ainsi que les bandes dessinées et le cinéma de science-fiction ont fourni les exploits techniques et les super-héros qui ont orienté les décisions des leaders politiques et des chefs militaires influents. Coiffant le béret vert, Buck Rogers, ce héro qui utilise ses talents virils et la technologie du 25e siècle pour livrer une bataille en règle aux hordes mongoles, pourrait illustrer un de ces paradigmes de l'imagerie américaine qui ont façonné la guerre. Bien que ceux qui prennent les décisions aient utilisé, pour exprimer ces fantaisies, un discours usuel dont la forme se voulait réaliste et pragmatique, le contenue de ce discours est démasqué quand on le compare avec la science-fiction qui traite de la guerre. Un membre influent du monde politique a méme publié une nouvelle dans Astounding qui révèle les racines de l'idéologie dominante. Mais, peu après l'offensive Têt en 1968, on vit apparaître, sous la forme de manifestations rivales d'opposition ou de soutien à la guerre, des écrivains de science-fiction qui, tout en reflétant les contradictions fondamentales entre les défenseurs de Campbell et ceux de la Nouvelle Vague, ont participé par la guerre et à travers elle à la transformation de la science-fiction. Les meilleures réalisations de la Nouvelle Vague en science-fiction tels que 'The Village' de Kate Wilhem, 'The Big Flash' de Norman Spinrad et The Word for World is Forest d'Ursula Le Guin utilisent la fantaisie pour montrer le danger de se laisser aller justement à une fantaisie débridée. En d'autres mots, il/elles emploient les conventions de la science-fiction pour dévoiler la science-fiction au relent d'infantilisme qui se jouait au Viet-Nam. Plusieurs anciens combattants du Viet-Nam ont fait passer des formes extrêmes d'aliénation engendrées par la guerre dans les écrits de science-fiction. Parmi ceux-ci, The Forever War de Joe Haldeman fait la caricature de la 'technophilie' rencontrée au cœur de 'l'Age d'or' des récits de combats galactiques. Après le conflit, alors qu'un nouveau Viet-Nam voyait le jour en Amérique latine et que la culture américaine abondait en fantaisies militaristes, la guerre apparaît sur le sol américain dans les écrits de science-fiction à travers des visions apocalyptiques de l'Amérique de l'après-guerre. Le paradigme puissant de la guerre au Viet-Nam en tant que science-fiction et fantaisie américaines s'est glissé vers une imagerie (tirée d'une histoire par Lucius Shepard publiée en 1984) de drogues uniformément distribuées qui permettent aux soldats américains de se transformer instantanément en Rambos pouvant perpétrer des massacres généralisés au Salvador ou s'adonnant à des actes de folies meurtrières aux Etats-Unis. / American SF helped engineer and shape America's war in Indochina, which then profoundly reshaped American SF. Indeed, the Vietnam War cannot be fully comprehended unless it is seen in part as a form of American SF and fantasy. Straight out of American pulp, comic book, and movie SF came fantasies of techno-wonders and super-heroes that guided the decisions of political and military leaders. A paradigm of the American self-images that helped shape the war might be Buck Rogers-as he uses his manly skills and 25th-century technology to lead the good fight against the Mongol hordes-sporting a Green Beret. Although the decision-makers' customary discourse expressed these fantasies in a language of ostensible realism and practicality, comparison with SF about the war unmasks their content. One key policy-maker even published a story in Astounding which exposes the roots of the dominant ideology. But shortly after the Tet offensive in 1968, there appeared-in the form of rival advertisements opposing and supporting the war-a roster of SF writers who, incarnating fundamental contradictions between Campbellian and New Wave SF, would participate in the transformation of American SF by and through the war. Some of the greatest achievements of New Wave SF-such as Kate Wilhelm's 'The Village,' Norman Spinrad's 'The Big Flash,' and Ursula Le Guin's The Word for World is Forest-use fantasy to expose the menace of being possessed by unexamined fantasizing; and more specifically, they employ the conventions of SF to dramatize the treacherous infantile SF being enacted in Vietnam. The extreme forms of alienation engendered by the war were transmuted into SF by a number of Vietnam veterans, including Joe Haldeman, whose The Forever War caricatures the technophilia in the heart of 'Golden Age' galactic combat fiction. After the Vietnam War, while a Vietnam War sequel has been shooting in Latin America and US culture seethes with militarist fantasies, the war has come home in apocalyptic S-F visions of post-war America. A cogent paradigm for the Vietnam War as American SF and fantasy has shifted to an image (from a 1984 story by Lucius Shepard) of standard-issue drugs designed to turn US soldiers into instant Rambos, capable of wholesale slaughter in El Salvador or murderous frenzies in the US itself.

AB  - A chaque époque, la vision prédominante du monde façonne les conjectures culturelles si profondément qu'on ne peut plus les distinguer. On les aperçoit seulement quand elles subissent un changement. Les lecteurs de science-fiction peuvent se rendre compte qu'un tel changement se produit aujourd'hui et qu'il s'agit du troisième dans l'histoire moderne. A partir de l'univers de Newton, composé d'un espace et d'un temps absolus, nous en sommes venus à un univers relativiste dans lequel l'espace et le temps sont des fonctions réciproques, l'énergie et la masse sont interchangeables et où le lieu de l'observation a son importance. L'univers d'Einstein a eu beaucoup d'influence sur la littérature. Mais aujourd'hui nous assimilons une des visions du monde les plus ardues qui soit, c'est-à-dire l'incertitude foncière de l'univers quantique. Il est certain que la mécanique quantique influence la science; son rôle en littérature est plus difficile à cerner. Cependant, l'incertitude, la simultanéité et l'attraction universelle se retrouvent dans les écrits post-modernes. La fiction de Samuel Delany, et de plusieurs autres écrivains, basée sur la mécanique quantique semble ignorer la déclaration d'Einstein qui affirmait que 'Dieu ne joue pas aux dés avec l'univers.' Les œuvres ainsi produites suscitent admiration, désapprobation et consternation de la part des lecteurs. Lire Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand en approfondissant la structure quantique pourrait contribuer à élucider plusieurs énigmes du roman. / In every age, the prevailing 'world-view' organizes cultural assumptions so thoroughly that they become invisible. Only when they change are they widely noticed. Readers of SF are experiencing such a change in world-view today-the third in recent history. From the Newtonian universe of absolute space and time, we moved to the relativistic universe in which space and time are functions of each other, energy and mass are interchangeable, and the relative position of the observer makes a difference. This Einsteinian universe has had considerable influence on literature. But we now find ourselves assimilating a third world-view, the most difficult literary world-view yet proposed: the radical uncertainty of the quantum universe. That quantum mechanics makes a difference to science is obvious. That it makes a difference to literature is less so. Yet the principles of uncertainty, simultaneity, and universal attraction do show up in post-modern fiction. Despite Einstein's protest that 'God does not play dice with the universe,' writers like Samuel Delany seem to produce literature, based on quantum mechanics, which does just that. The resulting works provoke admiration, protest, and bafflement from readers. An exploration of the quantum structure of Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand constitutes a way of reading it that may unpack some of Delany's enigmas.

AB  - Mary Wright publia deux utopies socialistes réministes aux Editions Gernsback sous le pseudonyme de Lilith Lorraine. Elle est la preuve de la présence de femmes-écrivains à l'Age d'or de la science-fiction ainsi que de la continuation d'une tradition utopiste féministe au cours des années 20 et pendant les années 30. Lorraine était poète, éditeur, enseignante, conférencière à la radio et voyageuse. Elle utilisa divers pseudonymes (dont plusieurs masculins) pour publier de la poésie et de la science-fiction. Dans un roman populaire publié en 1929, The Brain of the Planet, elle décrit une utopie socialiste qui évolue sous l'influence d'une machine émettant des ondes pensantes mise au point par un professeur extrémiste. Dans son 'The 28th Century,' elle met en scène une utopie socialiste féministe de l'avenir qui découle d'une guerre entre les générations. Son socialisme communautaire chrétien, ses analyses féministes de l'économie du mariage, son exposé d'une technologie alternative de la reproduction, son exploitation du thème de la télépathie et son apologie du préjugé racial en fonction d'une science de l'eugénisme rendent l'ensemble de son œuvre particulièrement précieux aux historiens de la science fiction. / Mary Wright, who published two feminist socialist utopias under the name Lilith Lorraine in Gernsback publications, offers proof both of women's authorial presence in SF's 'Golden Age' and of the continuance of a feminist utopian tradition through the 1920s and into the 1930s. A poet, editor, teacher, radio lecturer, and traveller, Lorraine published poetry and SF under seveal pen names, some of them male. In The Brain of the Planet, a dime novel published in 1929, Lorraine describes a socialist utopia developing under the influence of a radical professor's thought-wave machine. In 'Into the 28th Century,' she imagines a future feminist socialist utopia resulting from a war between the generations. Her works are important to historians of SF for her communitarian Christian socialism, her feminist analysis of the economics of marriage, her presentation of an alternate technology of reproduction, her development of the theme of mental telepathy, and her justification of racial prejudice in terms of a science of eugenics.

AB  - Parmi certaines idées concernant la nature humaine et la politique promulguées par Octavia Butler, on retrouve la notion que la nature humaine est violente et déterminée biologiquement. Cet écrivain pense que la politique ne peut pas participer à l'amélioration de la condition humaine; ce sont ses œuvres utopiques qui traitent de sociétés 'étrangères'. Les composantes idéologiques de ses écrits l'apparentent à de nombreux travaux féministes des années 70 qui sont de nature profondément libérale malgré l'élément utopique. Butler et ces féministes partagent les mêmes idées en ce qui a trait à la nature humaine. Ces notions ont pour origine l'idéologie de la différenciation des sexes qui fut élaborée à la fin du 19e siècle par les adversaires de l'égalité des femmes. Cependant, il y a dans ses œuvres une distanciation raciale qui est absente de la plupart des écrits de science-fiction et de science-fiction féministe, c'est-à-dire des personnages de race noire entièrement formulés. Cet élément est à la fois un enrichissement et une réprimande pour l'idéologie féministe libérale et pour la science-fiction. / Octavia Butler advances notions of human nature and politics which include the belief that human nature is violent and biologically determined. For her, politics is incapable of improving the human condition. Her works are especially utopian when she describes alien societies. The ideological elements in her works link her to many other 1970s' feminist SF works which, although utopian, are essentially liberal. Butler shares with them similar views on human nature, views which are rooted in an ideology of gender difference developed in the late 19th century by opponents to women's equality. Her works, however, contain one element of racial estrangement not found in most SF and feminist SF: fully developed characters of color. This inclusion at once enriches and rebukes liberal feminist ideology and SF.

AB  - La structure de 'Shikasta' transmet une vision de plus en plus globale de la réalité qui donne lieu à une expérience didactique qui peut transformer les lecteurs. L'auteur présente deux vues différentes et complémentaires de son monde fictif. La première, celle de la vision de 'l'espace intérieur', repose sur Shikasta (une représentation en diagonale de la terre) et traite de la croissance et du développement internes de ses habitants. La deuxième vision, celle de 'l'espace extérieur', scrute la planète Canopus et s'intéresse à une dimension plus vaste, à une entité plus englobante qui inclut Shikasta, les autres planètes et les empires. L'interaction entre ces deux représentations-l'effet que l'une a sur l'autre-détermine le sens du roman. Chaque perspective est illustrée par une voix narrative (bien que cette voix soit contenue dans de nombreux autres comptes rendus, rapports et récits). Pour la vision de 'l'espace extérieur', le narrateur est Johor; pour 'l'espace intérieur' il s'agit de Rachel Sherban. Rachel ne réussit pas à comprendre et à accepter l'aide des Canopéens qui lui serait apportée par le truchement de son frère, Georges (l'incarnation de Johor sur Shikasta). Le roman analyse l'incapacité de Rachel à surmonter les émotions qui la dissipent et son inaptitude à écouter les paroles de Georges et de lui répondre; ainsi la narration entraîne le lecteur à s'interroger sur différentes possibilités et sur d'autres comportements. Dans la vision de 'l'espace extérieur' de la première moitié du livre, les souvenirs des deux premières visites de Johor nous livrent l'impression sombre que les Shikastans sont des victimes impuissantes d'un accident cosmique. Au cours de sa troisième visite, les rapports froids, impersonnels et d'allue terroristes de Johor deviennent des relations plus tolérantes qui contribuent à mieux saisir l'atmosphère et la 'sensation' de Shikasta. De plus, le lecteur se rend compte graduellement que le changement qui affecte Johor se réfléchit dans le style remanié de ses reportages et également dans toute la structure du roman qui rend hommage à la nouvelle compréhension des Canopéens face à Shikasta. Les archivistes, responsables de la compilation de Shikasta, ont su reconnaître cette nouvelle perception de Shikasta telle qu'elle apparaît dans les rapports de Johor. Ils ont aussi ajouté des récits que d'autres agents ont écrit ainsi que la longue section finale qui révèle, à travers les journaux intimes de Rachel et autres documents, la manière dont les Shikastans perçoivent leur monde ainsi que la relation qu'ils entretiennent avec George Sherban. Idéalement, à la fin de Shikasta, le lecteur comprend autrement l'interrelation entre les peuples et les liens tissés entre une connaissance profonde du moi et du cosmos. / The structure of 'Shikasta' not only convey s Lessing's increasingly comprehensive view of reality; it also makes for a reading experience that can both educate and change her readers. She presents two different, complementary perspectives on her fictional world. One, the 'inner-space vision,' centers on Shikasta (a skewed version of Earth) and deals with the inner growth and development of its inhabitants. The other centers on the planet Canopus and deals with its longer range, more all-encompassing view which includes Shikasta and other planets and empires-the 'outer-space vision.' The interaction between these two perspectives-the effect of each on the other-is what determines the meaning of the book. Each perspective has one main narrative voice (although that voice is embedded in numerous other accounts, reports, and histories): Johor's in the outer-space vision, Rachel Sherban's in that of inner space. While Rachel fails to understand and accept Canopean help in the form of her brother George (the incarnation of Johor on Shikasta), the book's analysis of her inability to escape her distracting emotions and to listen and respond to George's words leads the reader to consider other alternative attitudes and modes of behavior. In the outer-space perspective of the first half of the book, the gloomy perception of Shikastans as helpless victims of a cosmic accident is found mainly in Johor's memories of his first two visits. During his third visit, his reports gradually move from cold, impersonal accounts of terrorists to more tolerant reports, which also better capture the atmosphere and 'feel' of Shikasta. Furthermore, the reader gradually becomes aware that this change in attitude on the part of Johor is reflected not only in the altered style of his reportage but also in the whole structure of the book, which is a tribute to the Canopeans' new understanding of Shikasta. The archivists who are responsible for compiling Shikasta have not only recognized the new perception of Shikasta embodied in Johor's reports; they have also added to them the accounts of other agents and the long final section that reveals-through Rachel's diaries and other documents-how Shikastans themselves perceive their world and relate to George Sherban. Ideally, by the end of Shikasta the reader has a new understanding of the interrelationship among all peoples and the connection between a deep knowledge of the self and of the cosmos.

AB  - La politique sexuelle d'Alice Sheldon est liée aux problèmes insurmontables de son enfance et particulièrement à la relation ambivalente qu'elle a entretenue avec sa mère dominatrice qui fut sa référence dans sa quête d'identification. Les conflits cosmiques de ses récits sont des projections de ses conflits intérieurs, des 'psychomachies,' c'est-à-dire des drames d'une personnalité en guerre avec elle-même. A travers toute son œuvre il y a un besoin puissant et constant d'unification, d'intimité et de sursis mais cette aspiration est toujours accompagnée de la peur opposée et aussi puissante du rapprochement, de la dépendance et de l'impuissance; une peur de se perdre dans l'autre. Afin de réconcilier ces désirs opposés-de rapprochement et de distance-Sheldon tente plusieurs stratagèmes mais aussitôt qu'elle a formulé une nouvelle synthèse, elle la détruit. Sans faillir, elle revient affirmer la douleur du conflit primitif: cette guerre du 'moi' contre 'elle' toujours perdue d'avance. / Alice Sheldon's SF stories exhibit a psychological pattern in which images of symbiosis are juxtaposed with images of extreme separation and estrangement. This pattern is, in part, projective, linked to the unresolved gender conflicts in Sheldon's childhood-and especially to her ambivalent relationship with her mother, against whom she defined herself. The violent tensions in Sheldon's SF plots thus express not only her overt sexual politics, but also a psychomachical struggle-the ongoing drama of a personality at war with itself. Sheldon's yearning for integration, intimacy, and surcease is evident throughout her work; but that wish is often defeated by an equal and opposite fear of closeness, dependency, and helplessness...a fear of the loss of Self in the Other. Whatever their initial trajectories, her stories tend to become vicious circles which serve to validate an elemental self-division-the no-win war of Me against Her. Sheldon's feminism is thus subtly limited. Although she empathetically represents women as alienated, 'toothless' victims, she is far less able to imagine characters who are free and whole female selves. Nevertheless, her work constitutes a precious achievement. She was never able to transcend her private pain and inner conflicts; but she was able to express that pain and conflict in precise and memorable terms. And in that emotional authenticity lies her enduring power.

AB  - Dans la culture patriarcale, les histoires qui traitent du processus de maturité des garçons soulignent la rupture avec l'image parentale; les récits qui racontent le même processus chez les filles accentuent leur initiation sexuelle. L'histoire du garçon concerne l'individuation; celle de la fille s'articule autour d'une nouvelle intimité et de la fusion de son identité avec son partenaire. Puisque les féministes définissent la maturité de la femme autrement, elles ont besoin d'un type différent de récit. Nous retrouvons ce genre d'histoire dans la fiction de Joanna Russ et précisément à travers la récurrence du schème narratif qu'elle intitule 'le sauvetage de l'enfant de sexe féminin': l'enfant est sauvée du patriarcat. Dans les récits de Russ, la secoureuse est toujours une femme entre 35 et 45 ans. L'enfant a environ 12 ans (l'âge approximatif de la puberté) ou, plus souvent, environ 17 ans (au seuil de l'éveil sexuel). Cette délivrance comprend 5 étapes de plus en plus complexes: (1) l'enfant est arrachée physiquement à une menace mortelle émanant de la culture patriarcale; (2) l'enfant est sauvée d'une culture qui l'handicape psychologiquement en dévalorisant son sexe; (3) (l'enfant est sauvée de l'obligation de l'hétérosexualité; (4) le sauvetage du 'soi' car la plus âgée des deux, grâce à une boucle temporelle, retourne dans sa jeunesse pour s'insurger contre les contraintes patriarcales ou pour les surmonter; (5) le sauvetage de la mère qui s'accompagne d'un geste significatif de réconciliation avec cette dernière qui a toujours été considérée comme celle qui enseignait et propageait la culture patriarcale et ses restrictions. Toutes ces phases importantes sont parties prenantes du réveil féministe et la science-fiction (plûtot que la fiction réaliste) facilite l'élaboration de ces étapes et amplifie leur développement. Dans ma conclusion, je rattache ce schème aux théories du développement de Carol Gilligan et de Nancy Chodorow afin de contribuer à son élucidation en vue des études féministes et des lecteurs. / Whereas, in a patriarchal culture, stories about a boy's maturation process typically emphasize separation from parental figures, stories about a girl's maturation tend to focus on her sexual initiation: his story is about individuation, hers about a new sort of intimacy and a merging of identity with her mate. But because feminists define female maturity in different terms, they need a different kind of story. In the fiction of Joanna Russ we find such a story: in the repeated narrative pattern Russ herself calls 'the rescue of the female child.' What the child is rescued from is patriarchy. In Russ's fiction, the rescuer is always a middle-aged woman (35-45 years old); the child is either about 12 (i.e., on the edge of puberty) or, more commonly, about 17 (on the edge of sexual awakening). There are five stages of this rescue, increasing in complexity: (1) the physical removal of the child from a life-threatening situation in a patriarchal culture; (2) the rescue of the child from the psychological crippling of a culture which devalues her as female; (3) the rescue from 'compulsory heterosexuality'; (4) the rescue of the self, as the older woman in some kind of time-loop goes back to help her younger self rebel against or survive patriarchal restrictions; and (5) the rescue of the mother, accompanied by some significant gesture of reconciliation with the woman who had earlier been seen only as the teacher and enforcer of patriarchy's limits. All of these stages seem to be important parts of the feminist awakening, and most can be more easily imagined and more fully represented in the mode of SF than in realistic fiction. My conclusion connects this pattern with the developmental theories of Carol Gilligan and Nancy Chodorow as a way to further illuminate its significance for feminist scholars and readers.

AB  - La toute dernière collection de recits non-fictifs d'Ursula K. Le Guin, Dancing at the Edge of the World (1989), semble témoigner du changement et de la naissance d'une femme-personne plus franche et plus encline à l'auto-critique. Cependant, une révision de l'œuvre de Le Guin en fonction de ses quatre mondes primitifs (Orsinia, Earthsea, l'univers Hainish et la Côte-ouest américaine de l'avenir) dévoile que l'auteur, qui a accordé tant de signification au lien entre le lieu et la personne, cette femmeterre, ubit pendant tout ce temps des métamorphoses mentales. De plus, ces changements sont particulièrement manifestes dans la fiction qui traite de son chez-soi, les écrits à propos d'Orsinia, le lieu d'origine de ses ancêtres en Europe centrale et les récits qui se situent sur la Côte-ouest où elle demeure. Dans ces environnements maisons-terres, elle bouleverse les postulats culturels qui ont trait aux genres, à la société et à la narration. En passant d'un monde à l'autre, la lecture de cette œuvrenous autorise à suivre un itinéraire qui la reconduit périodiquement chez elle afin de donner naissance à une nouvelle appréhension d'elle-même en tant qu'écrivain et femme. / Ursula K. Le Guin's latest collection of non-fiction, Dancing at the Edge of the World (1989), appears to be a record of change, of the birth of a more outspoken, self-critical womanself. However, a reconsideration of Le Guin's fiction about her four primary worlds (Orsinia, Earthsea, the Hainish universe, and the future American West Coast) reveals that this woman author who has attached such significance to the connection between place and person-this land-lady-has been undergoing changes of mind all along. Furthermore, these changes are particularly evident in the fiction about her home-the fiction about Orsinia, the Central European home of her parents' families, and the fiction about the future West Coast where she actually resides. In her home-world settings, she breaks through cultural assumptions about gender, society, and narration. Reading her fiction world by world allows us to follow a journey in which Le Guin has periodically come home to give birth to a new sense of herself as writer and as woman.

AB  - C'est en fonction du post-structuralisme et du post-modernisme que l'on peut rendre compte judicieusement de la science-fiction féministe des années 80. La science-fiction féministe post-structuraliste expose la problématique du langage en ce qui a trait à l'acquisition et aux structures de genres et de hiérarchie qui y sont enchâssées. De nombreux récits de science-fiction féministe publiés au cours des années 80 privilégient le langage et montrent une sensibilisation post-structuraliste à la puissance et à la contradictin inhérentes à la communication. Plus précisément, ces auteurs critiquent l'utilisation du langage comme outil de hiérarchie et de domination. De plus, le langage est employé pour démasquer les hiérarchies de la domination encastrées dans la pratique scientifique. Le lecteur retrouve de nombreuses composantes post-modernistes dans la science-fiction féministe contemporaine et ce à divers degrés. Les récits qui s'en préoccupent moins sont des écrits dont les analyses féministes sont incisives mais qui s'appuient très peu sur l'approche post-moderne du langage. A Door into Ocean (1986) de Joan Slonczewski et Triad (1986) de Sheila Finch sont des exemples de ce genre d'écrits qui mettent en scène le langage, la science et le conflit entre les sexes. Cependant d'autres textes témoignent d'une esthétique post-moderniste dans la structure même des récits. Always Coming Home (1985) d'Ursula Le Guin et La servante écarlate de Margaret Atwood (1986) (bien que moins marqué dans ce dernier roman) exploitent une orientation non-linéaire et une analyse de soi qui font éclater les distnictions traditionnelles dont celles des genres. Notamment, le récit de Le Guin étire la forme et la définition de la 'fiction' afin de critiquer l'étroitesse d'esprit de la culture patriarcale occidentale. Sa façon de renverser radicalement les structures traditionnelles du roman fait du récit de Le Guin l'écrit le plus post-moderniste de ceux ci-dessus mentionnés. / Feminist SF of the 1980s can be discussed most usefully in the terms of post-structuralism and post-modernism. Post-structuralist feminist SF problematizes language:in respect both to its acquisition and the gendered and hierarchical structures embedded in it. Many works of feminist SF published in the 1980s focus on language and reveal a post-structuralist sensibility to the power and contradiction inherent in communication. Most significantly, their authors criticize the use of language as a means to hierarchy and domination. At the same time, they use language to expose hierarchies of dominance embedded in the practice of science. The range of post-modernist elements in contemporary feminist SF is considerable; some texts contain few, while others are permeated with them. The first category comprises texts containing trenchant feminist analysis but relying only tangentially on a post-modern sensibility toward language. Joan Slonczewski's A Door into Ocean (1986) and Sheila Finch's Triad (1986) can be considered representative of this type, sharing an emphasis on language, science, and a masculine-feminine societal conflict. A second group of texts develop post-modernist œsthetics further through the form of the books themselves. Ursula Le Guin's Always Coming Home (1985) and, to a lesser degree, Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale (1986) exhibit a non-linearity and self-reflexiveness that together effect a breakdown of traditional distinctions, including generic ones. Le Guin's work in particular stretches the shape and definition of what is called fiction, and does so to criticize the narrow-mindedness of patriarchal Western culture. Her text is the most thoroughly post-modernist of the four because of the way in which it radically subverts conventional novelistic structure.

Vingt et un numéros virent le jour et le dernier fut publié à l'automne de 1943. Les trois premiers numéros étaient principalement (ou presque entièrement) le fruit de Thomas B. Kelley. A la suite, ce fut Melvin R. Colby qui adminstra Uncanny Tales. Il n'hésita pas à puiser dans plusieurs revues de science-fiction publiées aux Etats-Unis pour prendre des histoires qu'il réimprima dans sa revue sous de multiples noms fictifs. / My title refers to Uncanny Tales. Largely made possible by war measures introduced towards the end of 1939, this Canadian publication began appearing in December of the following year and subsequently ran to 21 issues, the last of which came out in the Fall of 1943. The first three issues were chiefly-indeed, perhaps exclusively-the work of one Thomas B. Kelley. Thereafter, Uncanny Tales was managed by Melvin R. Colby, who had no scruples about taking stories from various US SF magazines and (re)printing them under a host of fictitious names.

AB  - Bien que Borges fut un lecteur assidu d'Aldous Huxley, de H.G. Wells et de C.S. Lewis (pour nommer que ces trois), il se montra très critique de la science-fiction. Il est certain que plusieurs de ses écrits, par exemple, 'Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius' et 'Utopia of a Tired Man' semblent appartenir à ce genre. Mais de façon significative, une infime partie de son travail traite de cette dimension temporelle qui est une préoccupation constante de la science-fiction; en d'autres mots, il s'occupe du passé plutôt que de l'avenir. En effet, si nous considérons deux des trois exceptions à cette règle générale, nous voyons qu'il se tourne vers le futur uniquement par le biais d'autobiographie fictive. / Though he was a voracious reader of Aldous Huxley, H.G. Wells, and C.S. Lewis (among others), Borges expressed disenchantment with SF. To be sure, certain fictions of his-'Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius' and 'Utopia of a Tired Man,' for example-can be thought of as belonging to the genre. But tellingly, precious few of his writings have anything at all to do with the temporal region that SF is predominantly concerned with-i.e., he looks to the past rather than to the future; and in at least two of the three exceptions to that rule, he ventures into the future only in terms of fictive autobiography.

AB  - Quelquefois l'indolence concernant la fiabilité des éditions des œuvres de science-fiction peut-être génante. D'un autre côté, il n'est pas toujours aisé d'établir le texte définitif surtout quand il s'agit d'une oeuvre de H.G. Wells. Un parfait exemple est 'L'Ile du Docteur Moreau'. Suite à la première publication du roman, Wells a apporté des modifications à cinq reprises. Ce processus de révision (qu'aucune édition 'définitive' ne peut pleinement circonscrire) est un aspect significatif du texte au même titre qu'il est un fait tangible de l'histoire textuelle du roman / Insouciance about the reliability of editions of SF titles can sometimes be a source of embarrassment. On the other hand, deciding on an authoritative text is not always a simple matter, especially if the work in question is by H.G. Wells. 'The Island of Doctor Moreau' is a case in point. Wells altered it on no fewer than five occasions subsequent to its original publication; and this continual revisionary process (which no single authorized edition can do justice to) is as much a meaningful aspect of the text as it is a palpable fact of Moreau's textual history.

AB  - Dans 'Neuromancer,' William Gibson se sert des ordinateurs comme métaphore de la mémoire et de la personnalité. Il s'intéresse aux différentes manières que les gens utilisent pour se transformer sans difficulté. Des traces tangibles, oubliées par l'expérience, représentent la mémoire; une programmation en sorte. Pour la majorité des personnages de Gibson, l'impuissance à dominer cette programmation et à transcender le soi les portent à rechercher l'auto-destruction ou la désintégration. Ils veulent échapper à leur corps, à leur passé ou à leur mort future et leur choix se porte vers la technologie. Le plus souvent, ceci implique un détournement technologique, c'est-à-dire s'emparer d'outils et les détourner de leur fonction originelle. Dans le contexte du mouvement 'cyberpunk,' la transcendance des limites humaines par la technologie est une force libératrice et progressistes bien que ses résultats paraissent souvent monstrueux. Dans l'œuvre de Gibson, ce besoin humain de la transcendance est détourné et coopté par les gouvernements et les corporations afin de conserver le status quo. Ce procédé créatif peut être considéré comme un genre de détournement littéraire, un collage en prose d'éléments sémiotiques pris dans tous les secteurs du courant culturel. Cette technique le libère des difficultés créatrices qu'il éprouve ainsi que des restrictions inhérentes à la science-fiction. / In 'Neuromancer,' William Gibson uses computers as a metaphor for human memory and personality. He is concerned with how easily people can change themselves, and by what methods. Memory is represented as solid traces left behind by experience, a kind of programming. For most of Gibson's characters, the inability to overcome this programming, to transcend the self, leads to a desire for self-destruction or dissolution. They seek to escape their bodies, their pasts, or their eventual deaths, and technology is the method of choice. Most often, this involves technological detournement: appropriating tools and putting them to uses for which they were not originally intended. The technological transcendence of human limits, seen in the context of the cyberpunk movement, is a liberating, evolutionary force, although its results often seem monstrous. In Gibson's work, the human need for self-transcendence is itself detourned, co-opted by governments and corporations, in order to maintain the status quo. Gibson's creative method can be seen as a kind of literary detournement, a prose-collage of semiotic elements from every branch of the cultural stream. This technique liberates him from his own creative difficulties and the strictures of the SF genre.

AB  - La primauté de la vision dystopique sur l'utopique au cours des cent dernières années a créé un problème pour les auteurs de ce type de fiction. Les dystopies sont devenues banales et leur dimension subliminale a pris le dessus sur leur fonction cognitive, c'est-à-dire elles ont tendance à produire une catharsis à l'angoisse plutôt que de proposer une compréhension qui pousserait les lecteurs à agir pour changer le monde. Récemment, certains auteurs de fictions dystopiques du proche-futur se sont attelés au problème de la réduction de la distance entre le monde fictif et le monde empirique en faisant appel à l'encadrement pseudo-documentaire. Warday de Streiber et Kunetka est un exemple d'une variante contemporaine et journalistique d'un tel procédé. Par conséquent, leur dystopie paraît plus 'réelle' et plus vraie (à l'encontre de la dystopie idéologique) que bien d'autres écrits du genre. Ce récit met en évidence l'impression qu'ont de nombreux lecteurs que le présent immuable est l'illusion d'un observateur immobile. Cependant, l'encadrement et la structure de Warday soulignent que la catastrophe nucléaire est plus qu'une éventualité, elle est inévitable. La servante écarlate illustre une autre variante du même type d'encadrement. Atwood utilise la première personne du journal intime accompagnée d'un discours abstrait afin de bien démontrer à ses lecteurs qu'il est toujours possible d'assister à la réapparition de l'oppression des femmes. Dans cette narration, tout en établissant une continuité entre Gilead et Nunavit, l'encadrement pseudo-documentaire sert à railler deux sphères idéologiques distinctes mais compatibles de la domination masculine. Ainsi, dans ces deux cas, l'encadrement pseudo-documentaire est conçu pour contrecarrer la tendance contemporaine de mettre la conscience en veilleuse. En d'autres mots, il est employé pour réduire la distance entre le sens et le vecteur et ainsi promouvoir l'objectif principal de ce sous-genre de science-fiction, c'est-à-dire amener les lecteurs à changer le monde en réflechissant sur ses maux en fonction d'autres mondes. / The ascendancy of dystopian over utopian visions in the course of the last 100 years or so has created a problem for the writers of such fictions. As dystopias have become commonplace, their subliminative dimension has increasingly triumphed over their cognitive function-which is to say that they tend to produce a cathartic elimination of anxiety rather than offering the kind of understanding that makes their readers want to act to change the world. Recently, certain authors of near-future dystopian fictions have addressed this problem of reducing the distance between fictive and empirical world by resorting to pseudo-documentary framing. Streiber and Kunetka's Warday exemplifies the contemporaneous, journalistic variant of such a device. In consequence, theirs seems more 'real' and more truthful (as opposed to ideological) than many another dystopia. It exposes the perception that most readers have of the present as unchanging to be the illusion of a fixed observer. Meanwhile, both the framing and the structure of Warday emphasize that its vision of nuclear catastrophe is probable rather than merely possible. The Handmaid's Tale represents a different variant of the same kind of framing. To bring home to readers the real possibility of a resurgence in the oppression of women, Atwood resorts to a first-person diary accompanied by academic discourse thereon. In this case, the pseudo-documentary framing serves for satirizing two distinct but ideologically compatible spheres of male domination as it establishes a continuity between Gilead and Nunavit. In both instances, then, the pseudo-documentary framing is designed to thwart the modern tendency to put consciousness on autopilot. It is intended, in other words, to reduce the distance between tenor and vehicle and thereby further the fundamental purpose of this SF subgenre: to prompt readers to change the world by elaborating on its evils in terms of other worlds.

AB  - Le temps n'est plus où l'histoire de la SF relevait pour chaque pays du folklore local. Le développement de la SF, en tant que littérature mondiale, implique une analyse des relations que la SF américaine-qui a porté le genre à son niveau actuel de maturité-entretient à la fois avec l'histoire du genre et avec les littératures nationales. Cela implique une réflexion sur la préhistoire du genre lui-même, à partir du moment où, vers le 17e siècle, il devient un domaine autonome de la fiction et puis sur sa constitution engenre autour des œuvres de Jules Verne et de H.G. Wells. Avant Looking Backward et bien que des textes de science-fiction commencaient à être publiés aux Etats-Unis, la science-fiction américaine ne pouvait pas rivaliser avec les modèles européens. Entre les deux guerres, alors que la SF française se développe dans une atmosphère de méfiance face à la science et dans un cadre éditorial peu dynamique, la SF américaine se constitue non seulement en 'nouvelle catégorie de l'édition' mais en univers mythopoiétique original que le passage par le 'ghetto', où la peut-être enfermée Gernsback, a permis de rendre solide et puissant. La fin de la 2e guerre mondiale voit un déferlement de la SF américaine sur les ruines de la SF française, cependant, après un certain temps, cette dernière en sort revivifié-au point de choisir ses propres modèles et ses références (R. Bradbury, P.K. Dick) dans cette production américaine afin de s'en inspirer et, dans une certaine mesure, de tenter de s'en détacher. Cette nouvelle production française de SF donne des textes intéressants (Michel Jeury ou Serge Brussolo) mais elle n'a pas encore obtenu le succès auquel elle pourrait aspirer sur le marché américain. Car si la SF française a eu besoin de la SF des Etats-Unis pour se reconstituer, elle n'a plus à aucun moment depuis la mort de Jules Verne influencé la SF américaine. Celle-ci se développe selon ses propres tendances, ou en relation avec d'autres auteurs anglophones comme à un certain moment l'équipe anglaise qui publiait New Worlds. Cela ne signifie pas que la SF demeure à jamais un produit de standard américain: la SF française pourrait en effect se proposer comme un exemple pour hybrider la culture SF et la littérature d'avant-garde. / The time is long past when the history of a nation's SF was viewed merely as an extension of its local folklore. And the contemporary study of SF as a world literature would seem to call for a more detailed analysis of how the American model-which carried the genre to its current level of maturity-affected both the historical evolution of SF as a whole and that of certain national literatures. Such an investigation requires a look at the prehistory of the genre (inasmuch as SF, from the 17th century onward, developed as an autonomous fictional form) and the manner by which it assumed its generic identity around the works of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells. Although a number of SF-type narratives were indeed published in America during this period, the European SF model tended to dominate the genre, at least until Bellamy's Looking Backward. Between the world wars-a period when the publishing industry in France was far from dynamic and French SF itself seemed increasingly to turn toward motifs of anti-science and the fantastic-American SF began to distinguish itself not only as a new category of publishing but also as a cogent and highly original mythos-a 'new' SF whose identity was perhaps reinforced and strengthened by its literary 'ghettoization' during the Gernsback years. The end of World War II brought a flood of American SF into France and-despite the initial shock-ultimately served to reawaken and reinvigorate its nearly moribund French cousin. From this imported American SF production, French authors discovered new thematic models and references (R. Bradbury, P.K. Dick, et al.) which, during the subsequent decades, they have consciously imitated, adapted, modified, and-in some measure-attempted to distance themselves from. The resulting new French SF has produced a number of interesting texts like those of Michel Jeury and Serge Brussolo, but it still has not achieved the success to which it aspires, particularly in the American SF marketplace. The reason for this is that French SF, while it needed American SF to revive and redefine itself, has not really influenced the latter since the era of Jules Verne. American SF has developed according to its own internal dictates and in the context of other English-speaking SF authors (like the British who published New Worlds). This does not mean, of course, that SF will forever remain essentially a US-derived literary form: French SF could, for example, stand as an excellent generic model for the hybridizing of SF culture and avant-garde literature.

AB  - Dans les dix-huit derniers mois de sa vie, Blish avait préparé un roman de SF, 'The Breath of Brahma', en collaboration avec Joséphine Saxton. Sur la base de deux lettres, de matériaux préparatoires et de notes et brouillons, plus des chapitres en possession de Saxton, il est possible de reconstruire le développement de l'idée de récit en roman et une bonne part de l'intrigue de ce qui eût été une oeuvre ambitieuse et trés originale, pourvue d'une structuration en huit chapitres censés correspondre aux 'huit grandes questions philosophiques.' /// In the last year and a half of his life James Blish conceived an SF novel entitled 'The Breath of Brahma', on which he collaborated with Josephine Saxton. On the basis of two letters, outline material, and notes and drafts of three-plus chapters in Saxton's possession, we can reconstruct the development from story idea to novel and also much of the plot of what would have been an ambitious and highly original novel, with an eight-chapter structure reflecting 'the eight great philosophical questions.'

AB  - Une vraie 'biographie' de la science-fiction ressemblerait à l'histoire d'une femme déchue, par exemple la Sonia de Dostoïevsky. Né de parents instruits et imaginatifs, le genre 'science-fiction' vit le jour doué d'humour et d'intelligence. Mais la science-fiction était porteuse d'une tare mortelle: son pouvoir de séduction, lequel allait lui porter malheur. Le divertissement posé comme valeur, dans un contexte de pressions économiques et de flatteries prodiguées par le marché du livre, devait mener la science-fiction à la prostitution; perdant la face devant son héritage rationnel, elle avait en quelque sorte démissionné, et n'était plus à la hauteur de l'intégrité du genre ('intégrité' utilisé ici dans tous les sens du terme). 'The Torpedo of Time' (1924) d'Antoni Slonimski nous rappelle de manière poignante l'innocence perdue de la science-fiction. Le texte représente bien la science-fiction d'une meilleure époque et indique le chemin qu'elle aurait pu suivre, si elle n'avait pas cédé aux alléchantes propositions du marché. Le livre de Slonimski offre, non pas une idée bien lisse, qui entretiendrait des rapports plus ou moins étroits avec une histoire beaucoup plus sensationnelle (sinon lascive), mais offre plutôt une pensée profondément enracinée dans la substance même de la fiction-une réflexion sur la nature de l'histoire, sur l'inutilité de l'ambition historique de l'homme. 'The Torpedo of Time' ne constitue pas une oeuvre recherchée, à la mesure des exigences modernes de qualité. Malgré cela, on y retrouve le charme d'une certaine innocence, et ce même dans la naïveté des techniques littéraires de Slonimski. Tout compte fait, ce livre fera honte aux littérateurs d'aujourd'hui, qui prétendent écrire de la science-fiction. /// A true 'biography' of SF would read like the story of a fallen woman-say, Dostoyevsky's Sonia. Born of learned and imaginative parents, the genre came into the world possessed of noble intelligence and wit. But it also had a fatal flaw: it was too attractive for its own good. It was its entertainment value which, in the context of the economic pressures and blandishments of modern book-marketing, led it into prostitution, demeaning to its rational inheritance and also to its generic integrity (in all senses of the word). Antoni Slonimski's 'The Torpedo of Time' (1924) stands as a poignant reminder of SF's now-lost innocence. It exemplifies what SF used to be-and points to what it might have become had it not yielded to the seductions of the marketplace. What Slonimski's book offers is not a slick idea more or less loosely attached to an otherwise sensational (if not prurient) tale, but a thought profoundly embedded in the very substance of the fiction-a thought about the nature of history, about the futility of human historical ambition. 'The Torpedo of Time' is not a polished work by present-day standards. Yet even in the naïvety of Slonimski's literary technique there is something appealingly innocent. All in all, this book of his puts to shame most of the 'sophisticated' stuff that nowadays walks the streets as SF.

AB  - Kathleen L. Spencer. 'Le soleil rouge est au zénith, le soleil bleu se couche': vers une description stylistique de la SF. - Il s'agit d'une étude typologique de la SF qui cherche à répondre aux questions relatives au langage caractéristique de ce genre: (1) Par quelles conventions le lecteur interprète-t-il les énoncés de SF? (2) Quelles techniques utilisent les auteurs pour satisfaire ces attentes? L'auteur analyse la définition de D. Suvin qui établit le genre sur l'interaction de la connaissance et de la distanciation. En termes d'attentes du lecteur, cela veut dire que l'intrigue est établie 'quelque part ailleurs', en un lieu significativement différent du monde empirique du lecteur, mais que l'écart avec le monde fonctionnel est dérivé de façon logique, c'est à dire cognitivement valide, et que ce monde fictionnel est, comme le nôtre, régi par des lois naturelles. Ces deux attentes déterminent les caractéristiques littéraires du genre. L'auteur utilise la poétique structuraliste et la théorie de la réception et décrit la façon dont la SF adapte les techniques de la vraisemblance narrative pour présenter une civilisation imaginaire. La technique la plus cruciale est un procédé oblique par lequel la société imaginaire est décrite du point de vue de quelqu'un de familier à cette culture imaginaire s'adressant à un public fictif qui tiendrait pour acquis ce que le public réel percevra comme spécifiquement étranger à ses paradigmes emphiques. On examine d'autres techniques analogues et on vient à conclure que le texte de SF dépend d'une reconstruction active par le lecteur de la culture fictionnelle présentée à lui par des voies indirectes. /// My aim in this paper is to answer some questions about the characteristic language of SF as a genre: (1) What are the norms or expectations - the conventions - by which readers interpret the sentences of SF texts? How do they make sense of sentences (like the one in my title) which, in a 'realistic' text, would be nonsensical?; (2) What techniques do SF writers use to create and fulfill those expectations? I begin with Darko Suvin's definition of SF as 'a literary genre whose necessary and sufficient conditions are the presence and interaction of estrangement and cognition, and whose main formal device is an imaginative framework alternative to the author's empirical environment.' The two crucial terms, cognition and estrangement, interact to produce the SF reader's most fundamental expectations of the genre: (1) that the story happens somewhere else - that place, or time, or circumstances are significantly different from the reader's own real world; and (2) that the 'empirical environment' of the fiction is derived from the reader's own empirical environment in some logical, and therefore cognitively discoverable, way; and further, that this new environment is bound by natural laws as our own is. These two expectations together create SF's paradoxical relationship with reality - its 'realistic irreality' as Suvin calls it - which in turn produces most, if not all, of SF's defining literary characteristics. The next stage of the paper uses structuralist poetics and reader-response theory to explain how fictional texts convey the impression of reality, and then looks to see how SF adapts these techniques to make convincing the portrayal of an imaginary culture. The most crucial and characteristic technique is an obliquity of approach: rather than describing an alien culture frankly to an 'earth' audience from the outside, the SF author typically writes from the standpoint of an inhabitant of the culture addressing a fictive audience of his or her contemporaries, who take for granted precisely those characteristics of the culture that the actual audience will find most unlike their own real experience. Another technique relies on the power of a few unfamiliar (invented) terms, properly grouped and sequenced, to suggest the existence of a whole class of beings or experiences of which these terms are part. The common factor in all these techniques of SF is that they depend upon the reader's actively constructing an image of the culture being conveyed to her or him by indirect means, and hence interpreting the significance of details which the author narrator supplies but does not overtly explain.

AB  - L''Invasion of the Body Snatchers' de Don Siegel (1956) n'est pas avant tout une allégorie politique, mais une psychomachie complexe écrite par et pour des hommes qui, dans les années 50, se sentaient assiégés. Le jeu interne de l'Invasion représente une version bien traditionnelle de la guerre entre les sexes, dans laquelle l'antagonisme manifeste a été réprimé et reprojeté sous forme d'une guerre des mondes. La peur qu'éprouve Miles à s'abandonner aux cosses extra-terrestres-et tout ce qu'elles représentent-dit long sur elle et va de pair avec sa peur non-exprimée envers d'autres formes d'abandon: à Becky, son 'autre moitié' androgyne; à sa propre passion incontrôlable; et surtout à son désir inavoué (ainsi qu'à celui de Siegel) pour le sursis défendu. L'abandon, la passivité, la réceptivité, jugés comme de piètres faiblesses de femmes par la culture patriarcale des années 50, sont projetés sur les cosses extra-terrestres et finalement rejetés comme incompatibles avec des émotions d'hommes-en fait, incompatibles avec l'idée même de survie. La signification ambivalente des cosses suit une règle générale des récits de SF: 'tout ce qui est étranger est pour moi inhumain.' C'est à dire que dans l'Invasion, tout comme dans la SF masculine en général, les extra-terrestres menaçants représentent des projections déformées de l'anima-non pas des femmes en tant que femmes, mais des femmes en tant que des composantes aliénées de la psyché des auteurs masculins (de Jack Finney, du roman duquel l'Invasion tirée; de feu Daniel Mainwaring, le scénariste; et de Don Siegel, le metteur en scène). Siegel lui-même, insomniaque chronique, apparemment poussé par un besoin profond de contrôle conscient, destinait les cosses à représenter la dépression, le conformisme, 'l'orientation vers l'Autre'-tout ce qui est hostile à une définition palpitante d'une vie intensément vécue, et qui affronte ou se défile. Et il en est ainsi-dans son texte. Pourtant, dans son sous-texte, dans ses images, les cosses expriment, en même temps, des désirs très vifs d'abandon, de libération, d'intimité non marquée par les différences de genre, et d'intégralité androgyne psychique. Le film flirte avec cette vision du sursis, d'une vie au-delà du jeu macho. Mais il finit par reaffirmer les valeurs simplistes et bi-polarisées du patriarcat américain. L'amour de Miles, Becky, son 'autre moitié' pleine de passion, se révèle être un Judas qui trahit son maître avec un baiser, le laissant se faire secourir par J. Edgar Hoover et ses cohortes. Remonte sur le radeau, mon petit Huck. /// Don Siegel's 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' (1956) is not primarily a political allegory but a complex psychomachia written by and for beleaguered males of the 1950s. The inner game of Invasion is a very traditional version of the War Between the Sexes in which overt antagonism has been suppressed and re-projected as a War of the Worlds. Miles's fear of surrendering to the alien pods-and all they represent-is precisely parallel to, and comments upon, his unarticulated fear of other surrenders: to Becky, his androgynous 'other half'; to his own uncontrollable passion; and, most importantly, to his (and Siegel's) hidden desire for forbidden surcease. Surrender, passivity, receptivity, deemed by the patriarchic culture of the '50s to be mere womanish weakness, are projected onto the alien pods and ultimately rejected as inconsistent with manly emotion-indeed, inconsistent with survival itself. The ambivalent meaning of the pods follows a general rule for SF plots: 'anything alien is inhuman to me.' That is, in Invasion, as in male SF in general, the threatening aliens represent distorted projections of anima-not women but women as estranged components of the psyches of the male authors, auteurs (Jack Finney, on whose novel Invasion is based; the late Daniel Mainwaring, the script-writer; and Don Siegel, the direction). Siegel, a chronic insomniac, apparently driven by a strong need for conscious control, has intended the pods to represent depression, conformity, 'other-directedness'-all that is inimical to a thrusting, fight-or-flight definition of the intensely lived life. And so they do-in his text. But in his subtext, in his imagery, the pods also simultaneously convey deep yearnings for surrender, for release, for genderless intimacy and androgynous psychic wholeness. The film flirts with this vision of surcease, of a life beyond macho role-playing. But in the end, it reasserts the simplistic, bi-polar values of the American patriarchy. Miles's beloved Becky, his passionate 'other half,' is revealed as a Judas who betrays her lord with a kiss, leaving him to be rescued by J. Edgar Hoover and his cohorts. Back to the raft again, Huck honey.

AB  - La disparité dont j'ai fait état antérieurement (voir SFS no 24) entre la vision personnelle qui informe les 'Fondation' d'Asimov et celle qui soutend la série 'Dune' de F. Herbert se prolonge dans ce qui est devenu aujourd'hui deux tétralogies. Dans 'Foundation's Edge,' Asimov n'a pas répudié sa foi dans la science mentale et dans la technologie, il est simplement passé des psycho-historiens de la Seconde Fondation et des physiciens de la Première au monde idéal de Gaïa, utopie d'harmonie ultime dirigée par des robots (c.-à-d. par la technologie) ou par un déterminisme universel à la Skinner (voir Walden II), lequel en effet met à jour la science mentale ou la théorie du contrôle psychique pour se substituer à la psycho-histoire. En contraste, 'God Emperor of Dune,' dernier volet des 'Dune' de F. Herbert, montre Léto II avoir délibérément recours à des moyens psychiques et techniques d'oppression pour provoquer la révolte contre ses manipulations et son contrôle machinique. Son but est ici d'enseigner à son peuple les motifs et les moyens de se libérer d'une telle oppression afin qu'ils vivent comme le doivent des humains sans les contraintes d'un déterminisme Skinnerien ou d'une domination des machines. /// The disparity which I previously identified (in SFS No. 24) between the personal vision that informs Asimov's 'Foundation' books and that underlying Frank Herbert's 'Dune' books carries over into those series as tetralogies. In 'Foundation's Edge,' Asimov has not repudiated his faith in mental science and technology; he has simply shifted it from the psychohistorians of the Second Foundation and the physical scientists of the First to the ideal world of Gaia, a utopia of ultimate harmony guided either by robots (i.e., technology) or by a Skinnerian universal determinism à la Walden II (which in effect updates mental science, or psychological control theory, to replace psychohistoricism). By contrast, in the latest addition to his 'Dune' series, 'God Emperor of Dune,' Herbert's Leto II deliberately resorts to psychological and technological means of oppression to provoke revolt against his psychological manipulation and machine control. His aim is to teach his people the why and how of freeing themselves from such control: that they might live as humankind should, without the set limits of Skinnerian determinism and/or machine domination.

AB  - Hormis les 'opéras de l'espace', la science-fiction doit être prise au sérieux comme on le ferait, disons, Des voyages de Gulliver. Il y a trois sortes de science-fiction qui méritent d'être lues: la 'putropie', le récit apocalyptique, et l'anthropologie de l'espace. La première, comme Fahrenheit 451 de Bradbury, est une altération de l'utopie; la deuxième est une fiction apocalyptique telle que The New Wine de Christopher; et la dernière (celle que je préfère), comme Un cas de conscience de Blish, traite d'espèces et de cultures imaginaires. /// Exclusive of space operas, SF deserves to be taken seriously-as much so as Gulliver's Travels, say. The SF worth reading most ly falls into three categories: Putropia, Doomsday, and Space Anthropology. The first are corruptions of Utopia like Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451; the second, apocalyptic fiction like Christopher's The New Wine; and the last-my own preference-deal in imaginary species and cultures as in Blish's A Case of Conscience.

AB  - Les auteurs répliquent de façon polémique aux 'thèses' exposés par JF dans ce numéro. Ils voient dans ces thèses l'expression typée d'une idéologie déconstructionniste, d'un relativisme cognitif qui conduisent JF à reprocher au marxisme-roman noir et utopie eschatologique-d'avoir eu le tort de 'présupposer le réel' à la base de ses 'montages' narratifs. Les auteurs rappellent les apories auxquelles le relativisme radical de Fekete, son nihilisme gnoséologique, conduisent. Ils attribuent la vogue actuelle des idéologies déconstructionnistes à une panique devant l'inertie des pouvoirs en place. Ils cherchent à dégager un mandat actuel pour la science-fiction, au delà de la dérive infinie dans les simulacres et du narcissisme de l'impuissance. /// The authors reply polemically to the theses just put forward by Professor Fekete. In these theses they see the standard expression of deconstructionist ideology, of a cognitive relativism which leads Fekete to reproach Marxism-as dark fiction and eschatological utopia-for having made the error of 'presupposing the real' as the basis of its narrative settings. The authors remind us that Fekete's radical relativism and his epistemological nihilism lead to aporia. They attribute the current vogue of deconstructionist ideologies to a panic in face of the inertia of the powers that be. They attempt to make out a real mandate for SF, beyond the infinite diversions of simulacra and of the narcissism of impotence.

KW  - Marxism
AB  - Mes cinq thèses sont les suivants: (1) La science-fiction au 20e siècle est devenue une encyclopédie narrative de culture technologique et le marxisme en est un chapitre linguistique. (2) Par le biais linguistique, la science-fiction bâtit des mondes anti-positifs qui minent l'opposition entre le réel et l'irréel en résistant à la 'rédemption référentielle'. En modelant 'l'hyper réal' (le mot est de J. Baudrillard), le texte de science-fiction se comportent en 'simulacre réel'. (3) La fonction générique du roman est d'offrir une analogie de la représentation entre le modèle littéraire et celui admis empiriquement par convention. La science-fiction n'est pas soumise à une telle contrainte, et ainsi, du moins en principe, il n'y a pas de limite aux éléments existentiels, aux stratégies stylistiques et aux formes narratives qui sont abordés puis réunis dans le cadre générique si ce n'est que les éventualités restent déterminées par les conditions composantes de l'accueil réservé. (4) L'accueil que l'on fait à un texte ne peut être prévu intégralement grâce à la complexité des transactions sociales qui enferment et qui sont enchâssées dans ce texte. Néanmoins, on peut émettre l'hypothèse que la science-fiction se doit d'étendre ou d'adapter l'esprit de ses lecteurs à la culture et aux pratiques de la simulation, de renforcer le sentiment d'appartenir à une culture modulaire, de stimuler la perception de champs d'action malléables concernant la relation entre les êtres sensibles et ce qui est objectivé et enfin de programmer l'attente du plaisir et de la signification à partir de la sensation des différences. (5) Le marxisme cherchait à remplacer ses référents d'origine actuellement disparus et il est devenu plus crédible en tant qu'instrument méthodologique d'interprétation qu'en tant qu'histoire de revenants à la manière léniniste-stalinienne. Cependant, même un marxisme herméneutique, qui accentue le rationalisme militant et la logique binaire, n'est qu'une variante problématique de la science-fiction et, au mieux, partage les destins intéressants bien qu'ambivalents de cette dernière. /// My five theses are these: (1) SF in the 20th century has become a narrative encyclopedia of technological culture, with Marxism a linguistic subset of that encyclopedia. (2) SF linguistically constructs counterfactual worlds which undermine the opposition of factual vs. counterfactual by resisting 'referential redemption.' Modelling the 'hyper-real' (to use J. Baudrillard's term), the S-F text functions as a 'real simulacrum.' (3) The novel's generic function is to enact a representational correspondence between the literary model and what is given by convention as being empirically the case. SF operates under no such constraint; and hence (at least in principle) there is no limit to the existential elements, stylistic strategies, and narrative forms that can be accessed and brought together within its generic frame except as its possibilities are determined by the constitutive conditions of its reception. (4) The reception of a text is to some extent indeterminable in advance, thanks to the complexity of the social transactions which embed, and are embedded in, that text. Nevertheless, it can be hypothesized that the mission of SF is to expand or adapt its repondents' minds to the culture and practices of simulation, to reinforce the sense of being a child of a modular culture, to stimulate the awareness of manipulable fields of play in the relations between sentient beings and objectifications, and to program the expectation of pleasure and significance from ever new differences. (5) As Marxism has searched for substitutes for its original, and now vanished, referents, it has become less plausible as Leninist-Stalinist ghost story than it is as methodological organon for interpretation. Yet even a hermeneutic Marxism, with its continuing insistence on militant rationalism and binary logic, is only a problematical variant within the institution of SF, at best sharing in the latter's interesting if ambivalent destinies.

AB  - Timescape de Gregory Benford est de la science-fiction rigoureuse avec nuance. Benford est un savant qui aime la littérature et qui en fait et Timescape souligne la réciprocité des préoccupations des scientifiques et des humanistes d'aujourd'hui. Les problèmes scientifiques et personnels des personnages se reflètent de diverses manières significatives. La physique moderne présente la carte d'une réalité nouvelle et inconnue traduite en partie par des vérités psychologiques qui sont probablement familières au lecteur. D'autre part, les scientifiques s'intéressent aux expériences que font les humanistes avec la subjectivité et ils se rendent compte que l'objectivité demeure un idéal impossible. Souvent Benford paraît ressentir intensément cette bipolarité de la science et de l'humanisme, mais l'opposition disparaît dans Timescape ainsi que la distinction entre la science-fiction rigoureuse et le genre 'irréalisme' plus commun de Borges. Dans le roman, les dimensions esthétiques et mystiques de la physique théorique expérimentées par Greg Markham-personnage alter ego de l'auteur-élucident l'intégration des valeurs humanistes et scientifiques. /// Greg Benford's Timescape is hard SF with a difference. Benford is a scientist with literary taste and talent, and Timescape addresses the interplay between contemporary scientists' and humanists' concerns. The characters' scientific and personal problems mirror each other in significant ways. The new and unfamiliar map of reality that modern physics presents is conveyed partly in terms of psychological truths that the reader is likely to find relatively familiar. And humanists' experience with subjectivity has significance for scientists, who are finding that scientific objectivity is an impossible ideal. Though Benford often seems to feel the bipolarity of science and humanism strongly, the opposition dissolves in Timescape, as does the distinction between hard SF and the type of main-stream 'irrealism' that Borges writes. The integration of humanistic values and scientific ones in Timescape is illuminated by the aesthetic and mystical dimensions of theoretical physics experienced by Greg Markham, a character who can be seen as the author's alter ego.

Both disciplines deconstruct material space in order to portray what has not happened yet. Feminist discourse theorists deconstruct representational space to subvert traditional perceptual orders, while authors of feminist utopias construct ideal spaces in order to subvert political inequality and notions of historical inevitability. A consequence in both disciplines is the literalization of women's marginality and the reinscription of women's 'otherness.'

AB  - La science-fiction et la fantaisie ont un lieu de rencontre, la fantaisie scientifique. Il s'agit d'une forme narrative instable qui combine des caractéristiques des deux genres. Les personnages, ou les décors ou les événements du monde de la fantaisie scientifique comportent au moins une violation évidente d'une loi de la nature ou d'une contrainte scientifique tout en fournissant clairement une explicaiton structurée ou scientifique de cette même violation et en basant son discours sur une épistémé scientifique. La fantaisie scientifique, comme la science-fiction, présente un univers ordonné doté de lois communes, mais tout comme la fantaisie, elle contient au moins une inversion explicite d'une loi naturelle admise. Nous pouvons établir les frontières et les préoccupations thématiques de cette forme narrative en examinant deux récits de science fantaisie: l'écrit de Fritz Leiber, 'Conjure Wife' (1953) et celui de Stanislaw Lem, 'The Investigation'. C'est à partir de l'essence de la violation de la loi naturelle que nous pouvons distinguer différents types de science fantaisie. Les quatres types impliquent: la boucle du temps; les mondes successifs au présent; le monde anti-scientifique et le monde hybridé. En tant que sous-genre, la fantaisie scientifique interroge la science en doutant des connaissances scientifiques de base concernant le monde réel. Par la même occasion, elle scrute la fantaisie en interrogeant l'illusion des terreurs et des désirs qui hantent le monde onirique si riche en valeurs. La fantaisie scientifique est de plus en plus populaire, tout comme le 'réalisme magique' auquel elle s'apparente par certains côtés. Cette popularité s'explique car, d'une certaine façon, dans ces mondes contre nature, le réel et l'imaginaire, le prosaïque et le magique, le scientifique et le mythique peuvent se rencontrer et s'influencer et également parce que ces mondes nous procurent 'une telle beauté, une telle surprise ou une telle terreur absentes du monde réel' (C.S. Lewis). /// SF and fantasy have a locus of intersection, science fantasy, an unstable narrative form which combines features from each genre. A science-fantasy world is one in which the characters or settings or events presuppose at least one clear violation of natural law or scientific necessity, but which explicitly provides an organized or scientific explanation for that violation and which grounds its discourse in a scientific episteme. Science fantasy, like SF, assumes an orderly universe with regular laws, but, like fantasy, contains at least one explicit reversal of current natural law. An examination of two science-fantasy texts, Fritz Leiber's 'Conjure Wife' (1953) and Stanislaw Lem's 'The Investigation' (1959), enables us to establish the boundaries and thematic concerns of this narrative form. The types of science fantasy can be identified by the nature of the violation of natural law. Four main types involve the time-loop motif, the alternate-present world, the counterscientific world, and the hybridized world. As a subgenre, science fantasy tends to interrogate science by calling into question basic scientific assumptions about the physical world. At the same time it explores fantasy by questioning the unreality of the terrors and desires that haunt the value-laden world of dreams. Like 'magic realism,' with which it shares some features, science fantasy is experiencing a growing popularity, in part because in its counternatural worlds, the actual and the imaginary, the prosaic and the magical, the scientific and the mythical, can meet and interanimate, in part because these worlds provide us with 'such beauty, awe, or terror as the actual world does not supply' (C.S. Lewis).

AB  - Les écrivains de science-fiction française des années 70, tels que Michel Jeury et plus tard Dominique Douay, ont été grandement influencés par Dick. Mais qu'en est-il des années 80? Qu'en est-il de ces écrivains qui représentent ce qu'il est convenu d'appeler la nouvelle science-fiction française? Brussolo, Ligny, LeCigne, Volodine, Dunyach, Barbéri [et Jouanne] faisons partie d'un groupe d'écrivains dont les sources d'inspiration et les styles diffèrent considérablement. Ils n'adhèrent pas à un seul principe ou à un modèle esthétique unique mais ils sont liés par leur différence et par leur volonté commune de situer leur point de départ dans les formes et les procédés de la science-fiction. Quel image ou quel 'modèle' ces écrivains peuvent-ils emprunter au Dick des dernières années, à celui dont la 'trilogie divine' est apparue sur la scène française à la fin des années 70? Ils y ont trouvé un mélange radical de fiction et de non-fiction, des écrits qui fonctionnent au niveau d'une 'demi-réalité'. Dick ne décrit plus les simulacres, il les fabrique. Il entretient la confusion et la déformation des frontières au point de remettre en question les structures les plus profondes de son existence. Tel qu'Artaud, ou Beckett, il établit au coeur de la science-fiction la même subversion formelle tout en créant un effet radicalement ambigu. Les écrivains de la nouvelle science-fiction française ont choisi de suivre l'exemple de ce Dick plutôt que sa manière et de travailler de l'intérieur de la science-fiction vers l'extérieur. Ils admettent que la science-fiction pousse l'exploration des limites de la signification et du possible au maximum et ils ont décidé d'aller plus vite que le genre tout en respectant ses frontières et ses objectifs traditionnels. En utilisant un procédé analogue à celui de Dick, le résultat est une littérature de l'ironie et l'humour ravageant. /// Dick had a deep influence on French SF writers in the 1970s-e.g., on Michel Jeury and later on Dominique Douay. But what about the 1980s? What about the writers who represent what is called the New French SF? We have here a group of writers-Brussolo, Ligny, LeCigne, Volodine, Dunyach, and Barbéri [and Jouanne]-highly divergent in their sources of inspiration and styles. They follow no single aesthetic principle or model, and are united only in their diversity, and in their common desire to locate their point of departure inside the forms and formulas of SF. What sort of image or 'model' might these writers derive from the 'late Dick,' the Dick whose 'divine trilogy' came onto the French scene at the end of the '70s? What they find here is a radical fusion of fiction and non-fiction, texts that operate on a level of 'semi-reality.' Dick is no longer describing simulacra; he is constructing them. He cultivates confusion and perversion of boundaries to the point of questioning the deepest structures of his own existence. He performs the same subversion of forms as an Artaud or a Beckett, but at the heart of SF, and with radically ambiguous effect. The new French SF writers have chosen to follow that Dick's example, if not his manner, and to work from inside the SF genre outwards. Recognizing that SF pushes the exploration of limits (those of meaning and possibility) to the maximum, they have decided to go even faster than SF, while still respecting its traditional boundaries and goals. The result, by a process analogous to Dick's, is a literature of devastating irony and humor.

AB  - Le 'Yi-King' donne un commentaire de nature éthique à propos de l'hexagramme de la 'verité intérieure' qui ne soutient pas l'interprétation référentielle de ce même hexagramme fournie par Julianna Frink dans l'épisode final du roman de Philip Dick, 'Le Maître du Haut Château'. En effet, par rapport à ce dernier incident, le problème de l'interprétation implique un conflit thématique complexe entre les modes d'interprétation éthique et métaphysique rencontrés dans la suite du roman. Nous pouvons considérer la structure du monde du roman comme plusieurs codes herméneutiques générés pour entrer en contradiction avec un code fondamental de référentialité réaliste et qui offriraient également une réflexion critique de ce code référentiel. Cependant, ce même type de réflexion critique ne s'applique pas dans le roman à l'evaluation éthique des relations humaines authentiques. Dans l'épisode final, la tension entre l'éthique et la métaphysique régit la mise en abîme livrée à l'interprétation. Dans le 'Haut Château', la relation entre le sens de l'humain et le sens du réel est telle que l'éthique ne peut pas se baser aveuglément sur notre connaissance de la réalité mais malgré tout, notre sens de l'humain produit inévitablement une interprétation du réel fondée sur l'éthique. Ainsi il est impossible d'ériger l'idée de vérité et tout aussi impossible de ne pas en fournir une. /// The primarily ethical commentary the 'I Ching' gives to the hexagram of 'Inner Truth' does not support the referential interpretation given to the hexagram by Juliana Frink in the concluding incident of Philip Dick's 'The Man in the High Castle'. In fact, the problem of interpretation in the closing incident involves a complex thematic conflict between ethical and metaphysical modes of interpretation in the rest of the novel. The structure of the novel's world can be understood as a manifold of hermeneutic codes generated in contradiction to and critical reflection upon a fundamental code of realist referentiality. The same kind of critical reflection does not, however, take place upon the novel's ethical valuation of authentic human relationships. It is this tension between ethics and metaphysics which governs the mise en abîme presented to interpretation in the final incident. The relation between a sense of the human and a sense of the real in 'High Castle' is such that one's cognition of reality cannot reliably guide ethics, and yet one's sense of the human nonetheless inevitably produces an ethically determined interpretation of reality. The concept of truth is thus impossible to establish, but also impossible not to produce.

AB  - Le sens de la nature de l'événement pour Philip K. Dick diffère fondamentalement de celui avancé par les procédés critiques dont on se sert habituellement pour analyser son œuvre. La différence réside entre l'histoire et ce que j'appelle 'l'historicité'. L'historicité n'introduit pas des actions individuelles qui engagent les choses et les fixent dans quelque succession de temps absolu mais plutôt des actions qui les désengagent et qui les regénèrent en les poussant dans des directions fortuites et inexplorées. Contrairement à l'historisme et à la représentation monumentale qui caractérisent la pensée européenne, l'historicité résume l'attitude américaine ainsi que les procédés critiques qui en découlent. Nous devons replacer Dick dans son contexte national pour saisir ce qu'il fait. Et nous devons le faire si nous désirons comprendre comment Dick fait ce qu'il fait et comment il narre ses histoires. Je soutiens que dans la fiction de Dick c'est l'historicité et non l'histoire qui décide de notre appréhension du temps narratif et qui est également garant de son existence. Ceci a pour effet de créer des structures narratives diverses. Le lecteur assiste aussi à une libération du temps de la narration. L'événement narratif peut maintenant s'engager directement dans une sphère d'espace-temps plus vaste et indéterminée puisqu'il est libéré de la relation symbolique avec le temps réel, relation traditionnelle de la narration à l'histoire. Cette relation entre la narration et l'historicité constitue le champ narratif de Dick, un espace que les procédés d'analyse centrés sur l'histoire ne peuvent dévoiler. /// Philip K. Dick's sense of the nature of the event is fundamentally different from that assumed by most of the critical methods that habitually analyze his work. The difference at stake is that between history and what I call 'historicity,' which does not see individual actions engaging things so as to fix them in some absolute time sequence, but rather actions disengaging things, renewing them by moving them in contingent and uncharted directions. Historicity epitomizes an American attitude, as contrasted with the historicist and monumentalist vision that informs European thought, and the critical methods that derive from this matrix. To understand what Dick is doing, we must replace him in his national context. And we must do so if we are to understand how Dick is doing what he does, how he narrates his stories. I argue that, in Dick's fiction, what determines our sense of narrative time, and in a sense guarantees its existence, is not history but historicity. And this creates different narrative structures. What occurs is a liberation of story-time. Freed from its symbolic relationship to real time, from the traditional relationship of story to history, the narrative event now has the capability of directly engaging a broader, unpredetermined realm of space-time. This, the relation of story to historicity, is Dick's narrative field, a field which, again, history-bound methods of analysis may not fully see.

AB  - Dans l'œuvre de Dick, une référence directe à la théorie économique se trouve en un seul endroit bien qu'il manifeste constamment une compréhension et une acceptation railleuse de la dévaluation des objets entraînée par la production de masse. Il sait que la multiplication industrielle est notre principal support économique, mais sa passion pour l'authentique le pousse à refuser systématiquement cette multiplication. Il accepte cette prolifération d'objets seulement parce qu'ils soutiennent les individus. Mais il admet que ces mêmes individus, producteurs d'objets œuvrant dans des lieux de travail rationalisés, sont eux-mêmes organisés rationnellement et d'une certaine façon dévalorisés par la multiplication de leurs actions et de leurs rôles. Finalement, puisque pour Dick les réalités sont des fabrications humaines, il se doit d'approuver les drogues et tout autre moyen qui participent à la création de réalités uniques; mais Dick se rend bien compte que ces réalités peuvent également être multipliées. Afin d'atteindre de plus grandes unités, ses romans expérimentaux ont recourt à la coordination de réalités différentes et ontologiquement contradictoires. Mais quand cette tentative esthétique ne réussit pas à élaborer une réalité globalisante acceptable, Dick rejette finalement toute la base rationnelle de notre monde postindustriel et il accepte 'l'irrationnel comme la structure première de l'univers', un consentement qui se transforme en mysticisme dans ses derniers écrits et probablement en folie pendant les dernières années de sa vie. /// Although Philip K. Dick speaks explicitly of economic theory at only one point in his writings, he constantly demonstrates an understanding and chaffing acceptance of the devaluation of individual items caused by their mass production. His passion for the authentic continually causes him to reject replication even as he recognizes that industrial replication provides the essential economic support for us all. He accepts replicated objects, then, only because they support people. But he comes to recognize that the very people who produce those objects in the rationalized workplace are themselves rationalized, and in some sense devalued, by the replication of their actions and their roles. Ultimately, since realities are human constructs to Dick, he must applaud the use of drugs and any other devices that help create unique realities. But even Dick himself sees that these realities can themselves be multiplied. His experimental novels try to achieve their larger unities by coordinating diverse and ontologically contradictory realities. But when this aesthetic attempt also fails to construct a satisfactorily totalizing reality, Dick finally rejects the whole rational basis of our post-industrial world, accepting 'the irrational [as] the primordial structure of the universe,' an acceptance that translates into the mystic in his final writings and, in all likelihood, into madness in his final years.

AB  - Au coeur de l'œuvre de Philip K. Dick se trouve un procédé narratif automatique qui lui permet de fuir la rigueur cognitive tout en lui donnant le loisir de discuter de sujets sérieux par ailleurs inabordables. Nous savons fort bien que les règles prônées par A.E. van Vogt pour accéder à une écriture intéressante ont influencé Dick. Qu'une nouvelle idée devrait apparaître après 800 mots est le principe très important mis de l'avant par van Vogt. Dans une large mesure, ce sont des changements narratifs arbitraires qui génèrent l'illusion d'une profondeur consciente dans Le maître du haut château, Les androïds rêvent-ils de moutons électriques?, et SIVA. Cependant, s'il est exact que la quête du 'vraie' et de 'l'authentique' est au centre du projet philosophique de Dick, ce procédé narratif automatique est important et significatif au niveau thématique. /// At the heart of Philip K. Dick's work is a mechanical narrative device which allows him to evade cognitive rigor but which also liberates him to discuss serious issues otherwise inaccessible. It is well known that Dick was influenced by A.E. van Vogt's rules for interesting writing. Especially important is van Vogt's dictum that every 800 words a new idea should be introduced. The illusion of conscious profundity in such works as High Castle, Androids, and VALIS is to a large extent generated by arbitrary narrative shifts. However, insofar as the search for the 'real' and 'authentic' is central to Dick's philosophical program, the mechanical narrative device is itself thematically important and expressive.

AB  - Habituellement, les critiques opposent l'accueil chaleureux que Dick a reçu en France à l'absence d'attention manifestée par le monde anglo-saxon. Bien que vraie en grande partie, cette affirmation mérite d'être nuancée. Disons que son accueil aux Etats-Unis fut comparable à celui de Ray Bradbury. De plus, certains signes montrent que Dick pouvait publier ses livres sans difficulté et qu'ainsi il n'a jamais manqué de lecteurs. D'autre part, son accueil tant couru en France ne va pas sans ambiguïté et n'est pas entièrement dû à ses écrits. Son attrait est lié à une certaine conjoncture sociale, politique et culturelle favorable car ses œuvres sont apparues en français lors des événements de Mai '68. Leur prétendue description des Etats-Unis fut bienvenue pendant une période d'anti-américanisme résultant de l'implication des Etats-Unis au Vietnam. Ses écrits se sont prêtés à presque toutes les thèses intellectuelles en vogue en France à la fin des années 60 et pendant les années 70; de plus ils étaient fort attirants pour ceux qui s'impliquaient dans des recherches contre-culturelles. /// Critics usually contrast Dick's warm reception in France with the lack of recognition he supposedly had in the Anglo-American world. This statement, if generally true, must be qualified. On the one hand, his reception in the US was comparable to that of an author like Ray Bradbury, say. And the evidence suggesting that Dick's books were readily accepted for publication there by the same token indicates that he was never at a loss for readers. On the other hand, his much-touted acclaim in France was not totally unambiguous-did not entirely have to do with what he wrote. His appeal also had to do with certain favorable socio-political and cultural circumstances: his works began appearing in translation at the time of the evenements of May '68; their ostensible portrait of America was welcomed in a period of anti-Americanism that came in reaction to US involvement in Vietnam; his texts lent themselves to virtually all the intellectual approaches fashionable in France in the late '60s and '70s; and into the bargain, they were attractive to those involved in counter-cultural pursuits.

AB  - Les années 1979-1980 peuvent être considérées comme des années-clé de la 'science-fiction québécoise'. C'est vers cette époque qu'un système virtuellement complet de 'communication littéraire' se met en place et l'on assiste à une professionnalisation progressive des instances de production, qui sera accompagnée d'un mouvement de légitimation et de consécration. L'essentiel de cet essai porte sur une période largement antérieure, les années 1839 à 1974, et met l'accent sur quatre courants majeurs des récits conjecturaux-de SF 'avant la lettre': le courant des Lumières (1839) laissé sans postérité, l'ultramontanisme (1895), l'utopisme de la (pré)Révolution tranquille (1952), la découverte de la SF américaine (1972). On constate, à travers les récits majeurs de ces courants, où sont les points de mutation pour aboutir à la SF québécoise actuelle par un processus de secularisation et une prise en charge du devenir historique, notamment par les moyens qui donnent la science et la technologie. /// The years 1979-80 can be considered crucial ones for Québec SF, for that is the time when a virtually complete system of 'literary communication' (in S. Schmidt's sense) came into being in tandem with the gradual professionalization of SF writing and a movement towards its legitimation and acceptance. The focus of the present essay, however, is largely on the preceding period, on the years between 1839 and 1974; and its emphasis falls on four major currents in speculative fiction, or SF avant la lettre: the Enlightenment in Québec, with N. Aubin as its spokesman; the ultramontanism of J. Tardivel; the utopianism of G.-R. de Plour just prior to the Quiet Revolution; and the discovery of American SF, whose first notable Québec exponent is M. Gagnon. In considering the important exemplars of these four currents, a pattern of transformation can be observed which leads to Québec SF as it is today-this through a process of secularization and of a taking charge of future possibilities, notably by the means that science and technology afford.

AB  - Les critiques des romans du 'Hitchhiker' de Douglas Adams ont souligné avec justesse que les définitions habituelles appliquées à la science-fiction ne peuvent être attribuées à ces oeuvres. Il serait utile de considérer ces romans comme des exemples de science-fiction burlesque semblables par la forme et par la fonction à l'épopée burlesque. Dans les romans de Adams, nous retrouvons de nombreux procédés de l'intrigue propres à la science-fiction: quincaillerie exotique, formes de vie insolites et dérobades de dernières minutes. Mais chaque fois, les conventions sont utilisées dans le but de frustrer au lieu de satisfaire les attentes du lecteur habitué à ce genre littéraire. Pour ne citer qu'un exemple, le héros, Arthur, est un maladroit qui échappe bien souvent à la mort uniquement par chance plutôt que par l'habilité coutumière du héros en quête tel que nous le retrouvons dans la science-fiction conventionelle. D'une façon plus fondamentale, les romans de Adams considérés comme de la science-fiction burlesque défient les attentes des lecteurs de deux manières différentes. D'abord ils décrivent un univers mené par la chance et l'improbabilité tandis que la science-fiction conventionnelle soutient notre conviction que la nature est gouvernée par des lois scientifiques logiques et connaissables. Ensuite, les romans du 'Hitchhiker' dénient la 'fermeture' tandis que par définition, la science-fiction conventionnelle procure une 'fermeture' idéelle. Les romans de Adams présentent donc un univers réfractaire aux explications rationnelles et ainsi ils inversent distinctement les prémisses sur lesquelles la science-fiction conventionnelle est bâtie. /// Reviewers of Douglas Adams's 'Hitchhiker' novels have accurately noted that his works do not conform to any of the usual definitions of SF. One useful way of discussing these works is to regard them as examples of mock SF, analogous in form and function to the mock epic. Adams's novels employ many of the conventional plot devices of SF-exotic hardware, strange life forms, narrow escapes. But at every turn the conventions are used to frustrate rather than fulfill the reader's normal expectations of what should happen in the genre. For example, Adams's hero, Arthur, is a bungler who repeatedly escapes death by improbable chance instead of through the usual resourcefulness of questing hero of conventional SF. More importantly, Adams's novels as mock SF defy reader expectations in two significant ways. First, they depict a universe governed solely by chance and improbability whereas conventional SF affirms our belief that nature is governed by knowable, consistent scientific laws. Second, the 'Hitchhiker' books deny closure whereas conventional SF, by definition, provides ideational closure. The result is that Adams's novels offer a universe unamenable to rational explanation, and hence precisely reverse the premise that governs conventional SF.

AB  - Bien que 'Briefing for a Descent into Hell' de Doris Lessing comprenne de nombreuses techniques et idées que nous retrouvons dans sa série de science-fiction 'Canopus in Argos', la majorité des critiques ne considèrent pas ce roman comme de la science-fiction; ils en parlent plutôt comme une genre de psychodrame intellectuellement exigeant et sophistiqué. Cette lecture, orientée vers la psychologie, dépend en partie de la ressemblance entre ce roman et les récits de schizophrénie de R.D. Laing ainsi que de l'hésitation même de Lessing à identifier le genre auquel ce roman appartient. Aussi attirant que cela puisse paraître, l'interprétation psychologique ne permet pas d'expliquer de façon satisfaisante les multiples réalités qui coexistent mais qui sont souvent conflictuelles. A cause des limites du genre, lire Briefing comme un psychodrame diminue la tension dialectique entre le texte et le lecteur qui est au coeur même de la signification de ce roman complexe. Par contre, le lire en tant que science-fiction peut rendre compte des nombreuses réalités dès que nous leur accordons une existence réelle et ainsi la structure dialectique est maintenue. A l'encontre d'une lecture psychologique, le lecture de Briefing du point de vue de la science-fiction défie notre compréhension de la réalité et exige de nous un changement radical dans notre façon de voir le monde. Bien que le défi posé à notre manière de comprendre le monde soit plus explicite dans 'Canopus in Argos', c'est également une composante importante de Briefing, tel que le révèle une lecture par le biais de la science-fiction. /// Although Doris Lessing's 'Briefing for a Descent into Hell' anticipates many of the techniques and ideas found in her 'Canopus in Argos' SF series, most critics do not regard it as SF per se, treating it instead as a kind of intellectually demanding and sophisticated psycho-drama. This psychologically-oriented reading is suggested in part by the resemblance between Briefing and R.D. Laing's accounts of schizophrenia and by Lessing's own reluctance to identify what she believes its genre to be. Inviting though it appears, a psychological interpretation nonetheless fails to account adequately for the novel's multiple, co-existing, and often conflicting realities. Because of the limitations of the genre, reading Briefing as psychodrama also reduces the dialectical tension between text and reader that is central to the meaning of this complex novel. Reading it as SF, on the other hand, helps to account for the multiple realities by asking us to accept them as literally real; and this maintains the novel's dialectical structure. Unlike a psychological reading, an SF reading of Briefing challenges our understanding of reality itself, thus requiring a fundamental change in the way we view the world. Although this challenge to our world-view is perhaps most explicit in 'Canopus in Argos,' it is also an important component of Briefing-as an SF reading demonstrates.

AB  - Certains critiques n'ont peut-être pas accordé assez d'importance à la complexité et à la résonance dans l'oeuvre d'Isaac Asimov. Il est cependant facile de passer à côté de la profondeur de la signification de son oeuvre puisque certaines de ses influences semblent venir directement du siècle des lumières tandis que quelques nuances proviennent de penseurs plus modernes. Deux de ses séries d'images les plus connues, ses lois de la robotique et ses idées concernant l'histoire dans les récits de 'Fondation', illustrent cette endettement au siècle des lumières. Bien qu'Asimov écrive de nouvelles histoires qui développent ces images, c'est dans Les Robots et la trilogie 'Fondation' que nous retrouvons pour la première fois en profondeur les paradoxes traitant du libre arbitre et du déterminisme ainsi que la découverte du 18e siècle sur l'étendue et l'ordre de l'histoire. De plus, de tels dilemmes le poussent vers de plus hauts niveaux de généralisation et à cause de cela, il peut paraître simpliste aux yeux des critiques. Quant aux trois lois de la robotique, l'énergie qui est la source d'un grand nombre de permutations qui dérivent de leur simple 'neutralité' s'apparente au paradoxe que William Godwin nomme 'la nécessité'. Selon Godwin, les individues qui croient en ce déterminisme nécessaire impliqué par de telles lois ouvrent davantage sous l'illusion du libre arbitre et les récits d'Asimov semblent répéter ce paradoxe. De la même façon, Susan Calvin et les autres roboticistes dans Les Robots, ainsi que les protagonistes de la trilogie 'Fondation' jouent leur rôle avec conviction précisément parce que les conséquences paraissent être déterminées par le Plan Seldon. Mais plus important encore, dans cette trilogie c'est qu'Asimov semble fasciné par l'immensité et la singularité de l'histoire. Asimov nomme cet ensemble générale d'images ou de thèmes que nous retrouvons dans la trilogie 'Fondation' une 'généralisation mystique', qui paradoxalement (et je suggère, à la manière de Godwin) le fait passer de l'abstraction à la production de fictions centrées sur l'humain. /// Complexity and resonance in the SF of Isaac Asimov may be greater than some of his recent critics have allowed. Since his intellectual debts seem to derive most directly from the 18th-century Enlightenment with few of the nuances added by more modern thinkers, it is easy to miss the depth of meaning in his work. Two of his most well-known sets of images, his laws of robotics and his notions about history in the 'Foundation' stories, illustrate these debts to the Enlightenment. And although Asimov has continued to produce new stories which further develop these images, I, Robot and the 'Foundation' trilogy are his first full treatments of paradoxes concerning free will and determinism as well as the 18th-century discovery of both the vastness and the order of history itself. Moreover, for Asimov all dilemmas such as these drive him toward higher levels of generality. He may often appear simplistic to critics because he wants to be general. With regard to the Three Laws of Robotics, the energy with which a large number of permutations are derived from their simple 'neutrality' seems similar to the paradox in what William Godwin calls 'Necessity.' Individuals who are convinced of the necessary determinism implied by such laws work even harder with the illusion of free will, according to Godwin; and Asimov's stories seem to echo this paradox. Also, similar to Susan Calvin and the other roboticists in I, Robot, the actors in the 'Foundation' trilogy play their roles more vigorously precisely because the Seldon Plan claims to have predetermined the outcomes. But more importantly in the latter collection, Asimov seems fascinated with the vastness and strangeness of history itself. This general set of images or themes in the 'Foundation' trilogy represents what Asimov calls a 'mystical generalization' that paradoxically-and in a Godwinian way, I suggest-brings him back from mere abstraction to produce human-centered fictions.

AB  - Les écrivains de SF américaine se sont confrontés depuis toujours à une dilemme causé par trois aspects contradictoires du statut de 'littérature populaire' de leur discipline. La SF traite de changement; pourtant la plupart des écrivains qui s'y adonnaient étaient partisans de la mythologie des valeurs politiques et économiques des E-U, et croyaient que celles-ci devaient être maintenues. La SF se doit d'extrapoler plausiblement la connaissance fournie par la recherche scientifique; pourtant les écrivains publiant dans des revues lesquelles ne donnaient aucun intérêt commercial à une telle extrapolation ou d'autre formes de spéculation sérieuse. De plus, le tournant que prenait la science au XXe siècle, notamment la physique de Einstein et de Heisenberg, semblait devoir poser d'insurmontables obstacles scientifiques au développement effréné de l'imagination aventureuse si nécessaire à la SF commerciale, obstacles tels que la 'limite de vitesse universelle', soit, la vitesse de la lumière. L'éditeur le plus important de SF, John W. Campbell Jr, et plusieurs d'entre ses écrivains les plus célèbres ont toutefois essayé de résoudre de leur propre façon certaines de ces contradictions. Ils ont, en fait, extrapolé leurs théories de l'histoire et de la structure sociale à partir du concept d'entropie articulé par la Seconde Loi de Thermodynamie, des théories annonçant le déclin inévitable des sociétés existantes. Une telle attitude est bien sûr, compréhensible, vu le contexte socio-historique immédiat de la Dépression atteignant des proportions mondiales et le conflit militaire international commençant à gronder. Campbell lui-même (sous le nom de plume de Don A. Stuart) proposa une analogie directe entre le concept d'entropie et la structure sociale dans 'Twilight' et 'Night'. Ces deux oeuvres, de même que sa trilogie plus tardive, 'The Teachers', fixèrent les contours d'une vision du monde que la fiction publiée dans ASF par Isaac Asimov, A.E. van Vogt, et surtout Robert A. Heinlein, finira par rendre beaucoup plus explicite. Les éléments communs des écrits de plus en plus auto-réflexifs publiés dans ASF et traitant d'histoire et de structure sociale sont les suivants: la croyance que c'est surtout le développement scientifique et technologique qui fait mouvoir l'histoire humaine, à moins que la peur irrationellement émotive de l'homme n'y fasse obstacle; l'attente que la grande majorité des êtres humaines succombera à cette peur, ainsi qu'a leur faiblesse innée et leur sybaritisme; le préacquis que seule une petite élite de gens rationnels et courageux refusera de succomber, et qu'il ne lui restera qu'a choisir entre le fait de s'exiler volontairement et celui de gouverner de façon autoritaire la majorité; la théorie que seul le contrôle exercé par l'élite peut permettre à la société humaine de se développer de façon stable, malgré une attitude pessimiste quant à la possibilité d'une développement stable se perpetuant pour une période de temps prolongée. De tels concepts offraient implicitement, mais aussi de façon essentielle, un modèle pour les formes de gouvernement autoritaires. Et malgré celà, leurs partisans se révélèrent incapables de résoudre certaines des conséquences paradoxales du progrès scientifique et technologique identifiées pour la première fois par Campbell dans ses récits 'Stuart'. /// American SF writers have always confronted a dilemma with roots in three contradictory circumstances surrounding its existence as commercial literature. SF is about change, yet most of the writers who produced it were adherents of at least the mythology of US political and economic values, and believed that these ought not to change. SF is supposed to extrapolate plausibly from known science, yet the writers wrote for magazines that initially placed no commercial value on serious extrapolation or speculation. And the modern science of the 20th century-the physics of Einstein and Heisenberg-could place serious scientific limits, like the 'universal speed limit' represented by the speed of light, on the range of the adventurous imagination so necessary in commercial SF. The most important SF editor, John W. Campbell, Jr, and many of his most influential writers did try to resolve some of these contradictions in their own fashion, and extrapolated theories of history and social order from the concept of entropy articulated in the Second Law of Thermodynamics-theories that emphasized the inevitable decay of existing societies (within, of course, the immediate context of the worldwide Depression and growing international conflict that existed as they wrote). Campbell himself (as 'Don A. Stuart') drew an explicit analogy between entropy and social order in 'Twilight' and 'Night,' which, along with his later trilogy, 'The Teachers,' established the outlines of a world-view that will later appear in more developed form in the fiction published in ASF by Isaac Asimov, A.E. van Vogt, and-most significantly-Robert A. Heinlein. The common threads that run through the increasingly self-conscious ASF stories dealing with issues of history and social order are: a belief that scientific and technological development is the prime mover of human history unless thwarted by irrational, emotional human fear; an expectation that the vast majority of human beings will succumb to such fear-and to their own self-indulgence; an assumption that only a narrow elite of the rational and courageous will refuse to succumb, and that they will be able to choose only between self-exile and authoritarian rule in governing their relations with the majority; a theory that elite control is the only way in which human society can develop with stability, in combination with a pessimistic attitude regarding the possibilities of such stable development over any extended period of time. Such ideas provided-implicitly, but also essentially-a brief for authoritarian forms of political rule. And even at that, their exponents were unable to resolve some of the paradoxical consequences of scientific and technological developments first identified by Campbell in his 'Stuart' stories.

AB  - Il est nécessaire d'établir une différence théorique entre la science-fiction et son proche parent la fiction scientifique. Les romans de Jules Verne sont des exemples anticipés de fiction scientifique et ils diffèrent au niveau de la structure de la majorité des écrits de science-fiction. Les 'Voyages extraordinaires' de Verne sont orientés à dessein vers l'implantation pédagogique de la connaissance scientifique des faits. Le plan détaillé narratif de chaque roman scientifique de cette série illustre cette intention d'une manière catégorique. Par un examen diachronique de la place et de la fonction d'un tel 'discours didactique scientifique' dans les oeuvres de certains auteurs français de la fin du XIXe siècle et du début du XXe tels que Verne, d'Ivoi, Le Rouge, Robida et Rosny aìné, nous pouvons nous apercevoir d'une évolution tangible dans les recettes narratives qui sont employées. D'un côté, les passages déductifs et bien souvent simplifiés de pédagogie scientifique s'effacent progressivement et sont remplacés par des structures herméneutiques inductives qui s'emploient à mettre en valeur la vraisemblance de la fiction. D'un autre côté, la référence textuelle devient de plus en plus oblique, sans imitation et influe plus souvent sur le processus de lecture. C'est à travers l'étude de ces phénomènes narratifs que nous pouvons mieux distinguer la différence entre ces deux formes et ainsi assister à la transformation historique de la fiction scientifique en science-fiction. /// SF needs to be theoretically distinguished from its generic 'cousin' Scientific Fiction. As an early example of the latter, Jules Verne's novels are structurally different from most SF. Verne's 'Voyages Extraordinaires' were intentionally geared towards the pedagogical implantation of factual scientific knowledge. And the narratological blueprint of each 'roman scientifique' in this series strongly reflects this intent. By examining diachronically the place and function of such 'scientifically didactic discourse' in the works of certain French authors of the late 19th and early 20th centuries such as Verne, d'Ivoi, Le Rouge, Robida, and Rosny aîné, one can discern a palpable evolution in the narrative recipes used. On the one hand, the deductive (and often reductive) passages of scientific pedagogy become progressively muted and supplanted by inductive hermeneutic structures which serve to enhance fictional verisimilitude. On the other, textual referentiality increasingly grows 'oblique' and non-mimetic, more frequently affecting the reading process itself. It is through an investigation of these narratological phenomena that one can best differentiate Scientific Fiction from SF as well as witness the historical transmutation of the former into the latter.

AB  - La distance temporelle exigée en SF entre le futur imaginé dans le récit (et ce futur du futur que son narrateur habite en toute logique) et le présent de l'auteur et du lecteur est ce qui doue le genre d'une ouverture narrative illimitée. Trop souvent cependant ce potentiel inhérent à la SF d'offrir une vision temporelle qui soit plus ou moins différente ou alternative a été réprimé, non seulement dans le space-opera mais, délibérement, dans 'A Story of the Days to Come' de Wells, et tant soit peu involontairement chez Verne, Asimov, Williamson et d'autres. Ainsi beaucoup d'écrivains de SF jusqu'aux années cinquante et au-delà ont recours au futur pour rendre compte d'événements qui, du point de vue du narrateur fictif qu'ils se sont donné, appartiennent proprement au passé: Demain les chiens de Simak est ici une exception notable. Corrélativement, leur conception de l'avenir est trop souvent celle de l''évolution identique', l'avenir y est plus ou moins une extension du passé. Leur 'avenir' est la réplique transposée du monde que nous avons hérité du XIXe siècle et de la conception de l'ordre social et des exclusions qui l'accompagnent. En d'autres termes, ils proscrivent ou répriment ce que les romantiques appellaient 'Energie', ces pulsions 'instinctives' ou 'inconscientes' dont la dynamique introduit dans le cours du monde des éléments de hasard ou d'indétermination, aussi hostiles au capitalisme actuel qu'aux société totalitaires (à cet égard, le présent essai prolonge 'Chance and SF: SF as Stochastic Fiction' paru dans SFS no. 29). Cette tendance à dupliquer une conception de l'ordre mécaniste ou disciplinaire toujours latente dans le monde technologique en général - tendance évidente dans bien des récits utopiques ou anti-utopiques et composante réactionnaire dans les pensées de Freud, Marx, Saussure comme en SF - a été contrebattue par Brunner, Lafferty et quelques autres. Stand on Zanzibar - et ici Dick, Drode et le Burgess de Clockwork Orange anticipent Brunner - au lieu d'incorporer réitérativement cette idée dominante de l'ordre, multiplie les perspectives temporelles. A l'instar de plusieurs autres récits des années soixante, Zanzibar fait montre de sophistication dans le traitement de la temporalité, sophistication qui est apparue et s'est développée lentement et pas toujours sûrement depuis la fin du siècle passé. De tels récits avec leur complexité de perspective rapprochent la SF de sa vocation d'être une littérature de la 'réaltérité' nous offrant des formes alternatives de l'ordre et des modèles d'ordre social et par là transformant notre perception de la 'réalité'. /// The temporal distance called for in SF between the future imagined in the story (also that future's future, which the narrator necessarily inhabits) and the author's and reader's present is what endows the genre with its unlimited narrative openness. All too often, however, this potentiality inherent in SF for offering a temporal vision that is more or less truly different, or alternative, has been denied, and not just in space-operas, but (with deliberation) in Wells's 'A Story of the Days to Come' and (somewhat unwittingly) in Verne, Asimov, Williamson, etc. Indeed, most writers of SF up through (and even beyond) the late 1950s either expressly or in effect resort to the future tense to recount events which from the fictive narrator's standpoint properly belong to the past (Simak's City is one notable exception); and correlatively, they conceive of the future in terms of 'identical evolution'-i.e., as more or less an extension of the past. Nor is this the case merely in a superficial sense. Their futures replicate not only the world we have inherited from the 19th century but also the exclusionary notion of order that goes with it. In other words, they would proscribe or contain what the Romantics termed Energy, those 'instinctive' or 'unconscious' impulses whose traffic introduces the element of chance, or indeterminacy, as inimical to present-day capitalism as it is to a totalitarian society (in which respect, this essay extends the argument of 'Chance and Science Fiction: SF as Stochastic Fiction,' in SFS no. 29). However, that tendency to reduplicate the mechanistic, or disciplinary, conception of order still rampant in the technological world at large (a tendency evident in much utopian and anti-utopian fiction and a reactionary component in the work of Freud, Marx, and Saussure as well as in certain SF) is one that Brunner, Lafferty, and others have opposed. Stand on Zanzibar, say-and here Dick, Drode, the Burgess of Clockwork Orange, et al. anticipate Brunner-rather than reiteratively incorporating the dominant (idea of) order, duplicates-i.e., multiplies-(temporal) perspectives. Like a number of other SF narratives, most of them dating from the 1960s on, Zanzibar exhibits a sophistication in dealing with temporality that has been evolving (slowly and not always surely) since the end of the last century. Such narratives, by virtue of that perspectival complexity, bring SF ever closer to realizing its vocation to be a literature of 'réalterités,' giving us alternative orders and concepts of order and thereby transforming our perception of 'reality.'

La maturation de Selena l'entraîne à travers les quatre archetypes du caractère féminin - l'amazone, l'hétaïre, la grande Mère et la femme moyenne - jusqu'à l'intégration de ces archétypes dans une identité féminine pourvue d'un sentiment d'appartenance à sa société. Tout en utilisant des notions jungiennes, Maxwell modifie leurs partis-pris sexistes pour douer son héroïne d'un moi pleinement individué et dynamique. /// 'Change' (1975) by Ann Maxwell features a female hero, Selena Christian, whose psychological development through the course of the novel unifies the plot and converts a seemingly conventional work of SF into an example of both the female Bildungsroman and a Jungian individuation of the female. Selena's maturing process takes her through the four archetypes of female character-the amazon, the hetaira, the 'great mother,' and the medial woman-to the integration of these archetypes into a female Self with a sense of belonging to her society. While using the Jungian concepts, Maxwell modifies their sexist bias sufficiently to provide her hero with a fully individuated and potentiated Self.

AB  - À la différence d'autres récits de Clarke qui content une rencontre avec l'extraterrestre, Rama a semblé à bien des critiques offrir une image de l'indifférence cosmique plutôt que la transcendance humaine. Il y a là une sérieuse erreur de lecture qui vient de l'incapacité de distinguer les énigmes pertinentes du code herméneutique, sur lesquelles le récit s'appuye. Adéquatement décodé, le texte devient un miroir dans lequel le lecteur peut contempler l'avenir transcendant de l'humanité sans aucun besoin d'intervention surnaturelle. /// Unlike Clarke's other alien encounter novels, 'Rendezvous with Rama' has seemed to critics to offer a vision of cosmic indifference rather than human transcendance. This is a serious misreading, the result of a failure to distinguish the relevant enigmas within the hermeneutic code on which the text heavily relies. Properly decoded, the text becomes a mirror in which the reader can glimpse a transcendent future for humanity achieved without any need of supernatural intervention.

AB  - La publication du Naked Lunch de W. Burroughs en 1959 marque le début d'une nette influence de la SF sur le roman canonique littéraire. Cette influence se marque encore plus nettement dans les deux décades suivantes dans les livres de Kurt Vonnegut et Thomas Pynchon. Dans la SF, la même période a vu apparaître des écrivains comme Philip K. Dick ou Samuel Delany, résolus à étendre les limites du genre qu'ils pratiquaient. Cette influence a été souvent relevée; on n'a pas cherché cependant à dresser la liste des traits structurels et langagiers de la SF qui nous permettraient d'identifier le genre et de les appliquer à des oeuvres dont on peut dire qu'elles n'appartiennent pas à la SF. Je considère la SF comme un genre distancié et cognitif, créant un univers fictionnel alternatif (Suvin), dont le discours est caractéristiquement 'trivalent' (Delany). Il présente un niveau spécifique de 'subjonctivité' (Delany et Russ) et a recours à un 'paradigme absent' (Angenot). Il permet une actualisation qui n'est pas possible pour d'autres formes et fait un usage particulier de la science en établissant les règles axiomatiques de son univers fictionnel. Ces critères sont utilisés ensuite pour discuter l'influence du genre sur le roman canonique et pour décrire les manières dont les limites ordinaires du genre ont été subverties, chez les écrivains cités ci-dessus. Parmi d'autres ouvrages, je m'attarde au Dhalgren de Delany et au Gravity's Rainbow de Pynchon comme échantillons de cette SF subvertie. /// The publication of William Burroughs' The Naked Lunch in 1959 marked the beginning of a distinct influence of SF on 'mainstream' fiction. It developed most notably in the next two decades in the works of Kurt Vonnegut and Thomas Pynchon. Within the genre, the same period saw the emergence of a group of writers attempting to extend the perceived boundaries of their form, led by Philip K. Dick and Samuel R. Delany. While this influence has often been noted, there has been no sustained attempt to bring together the particular structural and linguistic features of the genre which would allow us to identify SF as a distinct kind of writing, and apply them to works arguably not SF. I begin by regarding SF as both estranging and cognitive, creating an alternative fictional world (Suvin) whose discourse is characteristically trivalent (Delany). It has a distinct level of subjunctivity (Delany and Russ) and employs a missing paradigm (Angenot); it permits an actualization not open to other forms, and makes a particular structural use of science in establishing the ground rules of the fictive worlds. These criteria I then use in discussing the influence of SF on mainstream fiction, and in describing the way the boundaries of the genre are challenged in the works of the writers listed above. Among other texts, I focus on Delany's Dhalgren and Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow as the exemplars of a kind of extended SF.

Toute tentative du lecteur de chercher une lecture unifiée est homologue à la quête donquichottesque exposée dans le récit lui-même, qui espère que la 'Solaristique' parviendra à une connaissance scientifique unifiée de Solaris. Lem inscrit cette contradiction complémentaire dans son récit par la technique de l''indétermination sémantique' qu'il décrit dans les conclusions de son ouvrage Fantastyka i futurologia: l'ambiguité hermétique qu'on associe du Château de Kafka et l'interférence des structures narratives propre au 'nouveau roman' français. /// Stanislaw Lem's 'Solaris' invites at least two contradictory, but complementary readings: as a romance of achieved Contact with the alien planet, and as a satire on the illusion that the Alien-Other can truly be known. The reader's attempt to find a unified interpretation of the novel corresponds to the Solarists' quixotic efforts to arrive at a unified scientific understanding of Solaris. Lem inscribes this complementary contradictoriness in the novel through the literary techniques of 'semantic indeterminacy' he describes in the conclusion of his Fantastyka i futurologia: the hermetic ambiguity associated with Kafka's The Castle and the mutual interference of narrative structures associated with the French nouveau roman.

De plus ces attitudes peuvent nous éclairer sur la nature particulière des livres qui appartiennent à deux genres bien différents, la science fiction et la fiction pour jeunes. /// A surprising number of SF novels for young readers are set in enclosed cities: the young protagonists of these books almost always escape the sterile, artificial environment that is their home, and discover a world outside it that is both closer to nature and much like our own world. In allowing youngsters who live in a strangely exotic place to discover and admire a place which is strange and exotic to them but quite familiar to us, the writers of these books imply some interesting attitudes toward childhood, adolescence, and maturity. Furthermore, those attitudes may throw light on the pecular nature of books which belong to two quite distinct genres, SF and fiction for young readers, at the same time.

AB  - Les personnages du Capitaine Kirk et de M. Spock sont les points de mire du récit et de l'intérêt des fervents de la suite télévisée 'Star Trek'. Kirk est basé sur le stéréotype masculin conventionnel caractérisé par l'agressivité et la domination. Ainsi l'attrait que les spectatrices éprouvent à son égard renforce les caractéristiques féminines traditionnelles de soumission et de passivité. En tant que l'étranger, Spock est signifié comme 'l'autre' et cette altérité est un lieu de reconnaissance pour les admiratrices qui, à cause de leur sexe, sont ainsi signifiées dans et par leur société. Mais le personnage de Spock est un amalgame de l'altérité et du stéréotype masculin traditionnel. Souvent il en résulte un renforcement accru des rôles sexuels et sociaux traditionnellement impartis aux hommes et aux femmes. L'analyse des rôles tenus par les Klingons et les Romulans (les personnages malveillants de la suite télévisée) montre d'une part, les différents niveaux de complexité dans la création de personnages humains, les Klingons et de personnages vulcains, les Romulans, Kirk et Spock, et d'autre part, l'idéologie sexiste qui sous-tend la plupart des événements et des personnages. On ne peut dénombrer de personnages féminins forts dans ce feuilleton et ceci est en accord avec le sexisme qui le définit. Bien que l'on ait cru constater un potentiel de libération pour les femmes dans le personnage de Spock et même si cette qualité lui fut accordée-puisque selon les apparences il sert à associer l'altérité à des valeurs fortes et positives -, il en est tout autre dans la réalité. Le plus souvent, Spock se prête au renforcement des rôles sociaux et sexuels traditionnels, limitatifs et contraignants qui sont à l'essence même de Star Trek. /// The focus of the narrative and fan interest in the television series 'Star Trek' is the characterization of Captain Kirk and Mr Spock. Kirk is based on a conventional male stereotype emphasizing qualities of aggression and dominance. Accordingly, his appeal for women viewers constitutes a reinforcement of traditional (submissive, passive) female qualities. As an alien, Spock is signified as 'other' within the series-and this otherness is a point of recognition for female fans who are, by their gender, so signified in and by their society. But Spock's character is an amalgam of otherness with a conventional male stereotype, and the result is usually an even more powerful reinforcement of traditional male and female sexual and social roles. Considerations of the major villains of the series, Klingons and Romulans, reveals both the different levels of complexity involved in the characterization of human (=Klingon) and Vulcan (=Romulan), Kirk and Spock, and the sexist ideology which structures most incidents and characters. No strong female roles are developed in the series, which accords with the sexism endemic to it. Thus while a 'liberatory potential' for women seems to be contained in (and has been ascribed to) Spock, as he apparently serves to associate otherness with strong, positive qualities, this idea about him is at best misleading; for on most occasions he functions as a reinforcement of conventional, restricted and restricting social and sexual roles, which are fundamental to Star Trek.

AB  - Les critiques anglais et américains écartent 'Attack of the 50-Foot Woman' l'ayant jugé au préalable comme une oeuvre dépourvue de valeur. Cependant, il est également possible de penser que ce produit des années 50 mérite d'être examiné plus sérieusement à la lumière d'une part, des autres films de la SF venant des États-Unis à la même époque, et d'autre part, en tant qu'anticipation des préoccupations concernant les nombreuses facettes de l'oppression des femmes qui seront énoncées avec précision dix ans plus tard par le Mouvement de libération de la femme. Le contenu latent du film présente l'héroïne en tant que victime de l'oppression sexuelle et économique. Par contre l'élément kitsch et les mécanismes freudiens de réduction et de décalage modifient ce sens; nous devons nous tourner vers les éléments constituants du film et tout spécialement vers le dialogue pour le retrouver. Ainsi l'héroïne est perçue comme une caricature de l'excès, un personnage monstrueux qui menace les institutions patriarcales et qui se voit obliger de quitter la scène. La violence mâle en parallèle à la violence psychologique que l'héroïne a dû affronter en permanence la contraignent à se retirer. /// British and American reviewers dismiss 'Attack of the 50-Foot Woman' as unworthy of any serious consideration. It is arguable, however, that the original '50s' product deserves serious examination both against the background of American SF films of the 1950s and as it anticipates the concerns about aspects of female oppression more fully articulated a decade later in the Women's Liberation Movement. The film's latent content has the heroine a victim of sexual and economic oppression. But the 'camp' element and Freudian mechanisms of condensation and displacement dissipate that significance. To recover it, we must look to the film's internal constituents, and particularly to its dialogue. The heroine then emerges as a figure of excess, a monstrous figure threatening patriarchal institutions and one who must, therefore, leave the frame. Male violence, parallelling the psychological violence the heroine has encountered throughout her life, forces her departure.

AB  - Depuis longtemps, le fantastique scientifique est perçu comme un moyen de pénétrer des situations psychologiques et psychosociales ordinaires ou bien, au contraire, comme une façon d'échapper à ces mêmes situations. Quelle que soit la culture d'origine, les collections de ces oeuvres de fiction sont susceptibles de révéler les préoccupations subliminales de la société dont il sera plus particulièrement question. Le Japon est une nation qui attire de plus en plus l'attention du reste du monde; néanmoins ce pays demeure mystérieux. L'image d'une culture orientale impénétrable et essentiellement étrangère est souvent mise en opposition avec l'idée également simpliste que le Japon doit ressembler aux nations occidentales puisqu'il a adopté un grand nombre d'éléments culturels de l'Occident. En me basant principalement sur certains produits de la télévision japonaise, j'examine comment les fictions fantastiques nippones révèlent et contribuent à la réconciliation des attitudes culturelles à la fois complexes et paradoxales. Je crois spécialement que ces oeuvres présentent des schèmes marqués en ce qui concerne la description des relations entre le monde 'réel' et les mondes du fantastique; de plus, ces schèmes sont les témoins d'attitudes fondamentales issues de cette culture ainsi que de sa relation avec le reste du monde. /// Science fantasy has long been recognized as an escape into as well as from common psychological and psychosocial situations, and collections of such works from any particular culture are likely to reveal the subliminal preoccupations of that society. For a nation that is occupying more and more of the world's attention, Japan remains surprisingly enigmatic to most people. Its image as an ultimately alien, inscrutably oriental culture is often opposed to the equally simplistic notion that, because Japan has adopted so many elements of occidental culture, it must be pretty much like the societies of the West. Concentrating especially on Japanese TV, I examine the ways in which Japanese science fantasies reveal and reconcile some of the complex, often paradoxical, cultural attitudes of the Japanese. In particular, I believe Japanese fantasy works display characteristic patterns in the portrayal of the relationship between the 'real' world and fantasy worlds, and that these patterns reveal fundamental attitudes about their own culture and its relationship to the rest of the world.

AB  - Les nouvelles théories de l'idéologie permettent de saisir plutôt de prétendus concepts, tels que 'le progrès, comme des symptômes (narratifs) de tout un rapport pratique à l'histoire et à l'avenir (aussi bien qu'au passé). La science-fiction, comme genre émergeant, est à voir comme le substitut de ce qu'était le roman historique pour la conscience de classe bourgeoise au début du 19e siècle (selon Lukács). De même que le roman historique, ses représentations ne visent qu'en apparence cet autre du présent qui serait l'avenir ou le passé; en fait, ses détours narratifs sont autant de stratégies pour rendre l'historicité de plus en plus inaccessible dans nos sociétés actuelles. D'où la fonction de l'utopie comme forme apparentée à la science-fiction: sa nature profonde n'étant pas de représenter ou d'imaginer un avenir véritable, mais bien plutôt de dénoncer nos incapacités à le concevoir, la clôture de nos imaginations, l'impossibilité où nous sommes, dans la société actuelle, d'élaborer une vision concrète d'une réalité radicalement autre.

AB  - David Ketterer. Panorama historique de la SF canadienne. - On propose de diviser en trois périodes le développement de la SF au Canada. L'époque des pionniers va de Mon voyage à la lune de Napoléon Aubin (1839) et se termine vers 1932. Pendant cette période, on note l'influence de la tradition utopique américaine et du genre britannique des guerres futures. Le titre le plus important est le roman de James De Mille. A Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper Cylinder. La deuxième époque va de 1932 à 1959 et est caractérisée par le nombre d'écrivains canadiens qui iront s'établir aux Etas-Unis, les plus notoires d'entre eux étant A.E. Van Vogt. On voit paraître des fanzines canadiens à partir de 1936. Dans la période moderne, on assiste à une accélération de la production et certains sous-genres peuvent être distingués: des textes occasionnels d'écrivains établis de haute littérature, des visions de l'avenir du Canada, des thrillers politiques d'anticipation à court terme. On note aussi des oeuvres d'écrivains britanniques et américains établis dans ce pays. La figure contemporaine la plus importante est Phyllis Gotlieb. DK termine en constatant les difficultés de la SF canadienne. Des sources de référence sont indiquées en conclusion. /// This attempt to uncover a distinctive history of Canadian SF has led to the determination of three periods of development. A pioneer period, beginning with Napoléon Aubin's Mon voyage à la lune (1839), ends around 1932. Various works influenced by the American utopian tradition and the British future-war tradition appeared in this time, but the most important title is James De Mille's A Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper Cylinder (1888). A second period extending from 1932 until 1959 is particularly characterized by the number of Canadian-born writers who settled in the US. The most notable of these is A.E. van Vogt. A Canadian fanzine tradition was inaugurated in 1936. With the acceleration of SF production during the modern period, certain categories can be discerned: occasional works by well-known, mainstream Canadian writers, visions of Canada's future, near-future political thrillers, and works by American and British-born writers now living in Canada. But the most significant contemporary figure-a writer born in Canada who continues to reside in Canada and who publishes superior SF regularly-is Phyllis Gotlieb. Some conclusions are drawn about the difficulties that Canadian SF has had in establishing itself and about the nature of the material that has appeared. Sources for further reference are described in a concluding section.

Mito et El Tragaluz de Buero Vallejo: les zones crépusculaires de l'espoir. - Dans ces deux ouvrages. des éléments de SF sont introduits pour mettre en scène la réalisation de l'espoir. Dans Mito. Buero a recours à une technique proche du voyage dans le temps pour montrer un lointain avenir où les problèmes de l'identité existentielle et de l'aliénation ont été résolus. Dans le second. Buero se tourne vers les mystères des espaces cosmiques. L'inconnu est conçu non comme quelque chose de fini qui décroîtrait avec le progrès des connaissances. mais comme une chose en expansion constante à mesure que le rapport entre connaissance et ignorance ne fait qu augmenter. Qu'il faille étendre sa portée en dépit de l'impossibilité ultime de notre quête. tel est le message que le théâtre de Buero cherche à communiquer. /// In El tragaluz and Mito, S-F elements are introduced to dramatize the realization of hope. In the first, Buero uses a technique akin to time travel to show a distant future where problems of existential identity and alienation have been diminished, if not resolved. In the second, Buero turns towards the mysteries of outer space. The unknown is envisioned not as something finite that decreases with scientific advances, but infinite and rapidly expanding as the interface between knowledge and ignorance increases. To reach out, in spite of the impossibility of our quest, is a message which Buero's theater attempts to instill in us.

AB  - H. Bruce Franklin. 'Ne cherche pas à savoir où on va': les Visions de l'avenir dans le cinéma de SF de 1970 à 1982 - L'auteur procède a un examen systématique de cette production anglo-américaine; on assiste à un abandon significatif des films de monstre et de fin du monde des années cinquante et soixante. Un imaginaire du désespoir s'exprime, qui reflète la désintégration sociale et économique d'un empire mondial et contient de nombres présages pour l'avenir. On centre l'examen sur les transformations de deux archétypes reçus de la tradition filmique antérieure-la 'Merveilleuse Ville du Future' et 'Ces Sensationnelles Machines volantes'-et on délimite par là certains points critiques de l'imagination culturelle d'une société qui se sent gravement malade, ne peut plus concevoir un avenir riant et consomme compulsivement le présent en vue d'éliminer tout avenir possible. /// A systematic examination of the visions of the future projected in Anglo-American SF films from 1970 through mid-1982 reveals a significant shift from the monster and doomsday movies of the 1950s and 1960s. These cinematic projections of the imagination of despair express the accelerating social and economic disintegration of a world empire and contain ominous implications about the actual future. By focusing on the transformations of the two key archetypes received from early SF movies-'The Wonder City of the Future' and 'The Marvelous Flying Machine'-it is possible to chart critical areas of the cultural imagination of a society that perceives itself as terminally ill, cannot conceive of a better future, and is compulsively consuming the present in order to produce the means for eliminating any human future.

AB  - Martin Bridgstock. Approche psychologique de la SF 'hard'. - L'étude cherche à relier l'attrait que présente la SF 'hard' à certaines caractéristiques psychologiques de ses lecteurs. On admet que ce type bien délimité de SF joue pour ceux-ci une fonction de relaxation et de confirmation d'idées déjà acquises. Le type psychologique que L. Hudson a qualifié de 'converger' (faibles résultats aux tests de créativité, hauts résultats au Q.I. conventionnel) correspond à une part de ce public. Ce type embrasse toute une constellation d'attributs caractérologiques avec une approche de la vie essentiellement rationnelle et cherchant à éliminer les émotions et à fuir l'irrationalité. La lecture du 'converger' joue un rôle de maintenance, d'entretien en 'état de marche' et de renforcement de conceptions de vie déjà acquises. Il trouvera une satisfaction dans des intrigues où l'irrationalité et le chaos, dans le monde et dans l'individu, se trouvent finalement dominés ou éliminés. Deux récits bien connus 'Neutron Star' et 'Nightfall' servent à illustrer les hypothèses. Le goût pour la fantaisie spéculative et le 'New Wave' est par contraste lié au pôle psychologique opposé de la 'divergence'. Certaines difficultés et insuffisances de l'hypothèse présentée sont discutées en conclusion. /// 'A Psychological Approach...' outlines a theory relating the appeal of 'hard' SF to the psychological characteristics of its readers. It seems safe to suppose that reading serves (among other things) the function of 'maintenance'-of confirming or reinforcing certain trait-preferences. In the case of 'hard' SF, MB argues that the reader in question fits Liam Hudson's description of a 'converger.' She or (more frequently) he takes a rational approach to life and seeks to screen out emotion and irrationality. The appeal of stories like 'Neutron Star' or 'Nightfall' to the 'converger' lies in their portrayal of problem-solvers as admirable types and of rationalistic approaches to problems as the only kind feasible - themes that fulfill a 'maintenance' objective by assuring the 'converger' that rationality will ultimately triumph over chaos. On the other hand, the antithesis of the 'converger' will not - if theory holds - share this liking for 'hard' SF. The tastes of the 'divergers' will instead run to fantasy and 'New Wave' SF: what they find congenial are escapes from rational calculation and explorations of the psyche. This theory no doubt has its shortcomings; but it may also provide a start for a new way of examining the sociology of readership.

AB  - Boris Eizykman. Le hasard et la SF: la SF comme stochastique fiction. - Philip K. Dick dans Loterie Solaire et Gérard Klein dans Le sceptre du hasard ont tous deux suggéré que le hasard pourrait être réintégré volontairement dans les mécanismes d'une société 'parfaite'. Le hasard subvertit les lois, les rationalités, les déterminismes; il remet du chaos dans l'ordre et sonne le glas des visions utopiques d'un monde parfaitement ordonné. L'auteur cherche à montrer comment, à travers diverses pensées modernes, les images du hasard se construisent en s'opposant aux images des images des pouvoirs rationnels et de la prévisibilité des échanges sociaux. La SF devient ici la littérature des réalités alternatives se servant du hasard, sous les formes les plus effervescentes de ses aspects pulsionnels pour créer des sociétés fluides et métamorphiques. Divers récits de Dick, Ellison, Silverberg et Jeury servent à mettre en lumière ce courant de 'fiction stochastique'. /// Philip K. Dick in Solar Lottery and Gérard Klein in Le sceptre du hasard have both suggested that chance could be reintegrated, as a matter of choice, into the mechanisms of a 'perfect' society. Chance finally subverts all laws, all rationalities, all determinisms; it reinstates chaos into order and sounds the knell for utopian visions of a perfectly regulated world. Though noting that chance also designates that indeterminacy which can be made consonant with technocratic rationality - and noting, too, that this sense of the word applies to a certain kind of utopian and science fiction - BE concentrates on chance as an oppositional force in the modern world. He seeks to demonstrate how, in relation to a variety of modern thinkers, the images of chance constitute themselves as the antithesis of those expressive of rational power and of the predictability of social change that goes with it. In this respect, SF becomes the literature of alternative realities subservient to chance, which represents the driving force behind the creation of fluid social metamorphoses. Indeed, BE cites a variety of stories - by Dick, Harlan Ellison, Robert Silverberg, and Michel Jeury - to prove that it is not far-fetched to think of SF as signifying 'stochastic fiction.'

AB  - James Gunn. Les Gardiens de la Porte. - Le développement de la SF comme genre a été orienté et déterminé de façon significative par les éditeurs. Leur influence prépondérante s'établit avec la naissance au début du siècle des premiers magazines consacrés exclusivement à produire de la SF en un 'milieu clos'. Frank Munsey d'abord. et les autres éditeurs de 'pulp magazines' ont changé les habitudes de lecture de toute une génération. JG décrit l'attitude et les conceptions éditoriales d'Hugo Gernsback. le créateur d'Amazing Stories (1926-1929) puis de Wonder Stories: il passe en revue les politiques successives des magazines de l'entre-deuxguerres. Le pouvoir de l'éditeur culmine dans la personne de Campbell qui sélectionna activement certains types de récit et intervint directement pour orienter la production des auteurs qu'il recrutait. Des exigences et des conceptions de Campbell dans Astounding entre 1937 et 1950 a surgi la conception 'moderne' de la SF. De nouveaux critères et de nouveaux modèles se font jour dans les années cinquante, mais ici encore l'influence des revues et de leurs rédacteurs-en-chef est déterminante. Cette influence passe certainement par le fait que, si modestement payés qu'aient été les auteurs, la question du salaire et de la survie professionnelle est directement mêlée aux politiques éditoriales des quelques revues où ils pouvaient placer leur copie. Dans les années cinquante, le marché du livre commence à s'ouvrir et une expansion du champ thématique de la SF s'ensuit. Un éditeur comme Moorcock encourage les audaces et la révolution génologique qui donne cours au 'New Wave'. Aujourd'hui c'est par le livre que la SF se diffuse. Les Gardiens de la Porte ont disparu et le royaume qu'ils gardaient est en train de s'écrouler. The development of SF as a genre has been directed and determined to a significant extent by editors. They established their preponderant influence at the beginning of this century with the appearance of the first magazines devoted exclusively to producing SF in a 'closed milieu.' Frank Munsey, first, and then other editors of 'pulp magazines,' changed the reading habits of an entire generation. Witness the power of the stance and editorial biases of Hugo Gernsback (the creator of Amazing Stories (1926-29), and later of Wonder Stories), and also of the subsequent policies of the SF magazines of the between-wars period. The power of the editor culminates in the person of John W. Campbell, who actively sought certain types of stories and intervened directly to influence the work of the authors whom he recruited. Out of the needs and preferences that Campbell made Astounding a vehicle for between 1937 and 1950 came the 'modern' understanding of what SF is. New criteria and new models came on the scene in the 1950s; but here, too, the influence of the magazines and their editors-in-chief has been a determining factor. Indeed, that editorial influence can be gauged by the fact that authors frequently subordinated financial considerations (which in any event remained for most of them too modest to live on) to those of the editorial policy and prestige of the magazine in which they would choose to 'place' their fiction. In the 1950s, the paperback market began to expand, and with it the thematic field of SF. Even so, the 1960s' influence of the last of the Gatekeepers was considerable: Michael Moorcock, in his capacity as editor of New Worlds, encouraged the bold departures from previous practice which produced the generic revolution known as the 'New Wave.' These days, however, books have taken over from magazines as the principal format in which SF is read. It is now the book-publishers, rather than the magazine editors, who determine what counts as SF - and these days almost anything might be marketed under the rubric. In short, the Gatekeepers have disappeared, and the kingdom that they guarded is in the process of falling apart.

AB  - Seule la S-F, dans les littératures anglo-saxonnes, a retenu le thème des grandes étendues naturelles-forêt, océans, déserts, montagnes-comme motif narratif, avec ses données de défi adressé à l'homme, d'exploration, d'émerveillement et d'espoir. Ce thème a au contraire été s'estompant dans les autres courants littéraires depuis la guerre. Il s'agit cependant, comme on le sait, d'un thème correspondant à un complexe d'idéaux américains, tout en étant présent à l'origine de toutes civilisations. La représentation de la nature sauvage doit se distinguer de la thématique pastorale; même si certains écrivains ont cherché à mélanger les deux, les traits qui les définissent s'opposent terme à terme. L'auteur examine les caractères et les avatars du thème chez Jack Vance, Thomas Disch, Simak et Le Guin. Chez Vance, les espaces naturels sont durs et inflexibles à l'homme qui doit y vivre et y mourir. Chez Disch, The Genocides, on trouve le rejet de l'admiration et de l'émerveillement qui connotent traditionnellement le thème. Le monde sauvage est l'ennemi de l'homme. Avatar que retourne Simak chez qui c'est l'humanité qui est féroce et sauvage et la nature qui est paisible et débonnaire (City). Le Guin combine dans le Nom du monde est Forêt la grande étendue naturelle et la vision pastorale. Là encore c'est l'humanité qui est névrotiquement agressive. L'article étudie la forme spécifique que prend la représentation des grandes étendues en S-F: celle de l'espace interstellaire, du vide cosmique. Le complexe imaginatif lié à ce thème et est illustré par l'examen de Destination: Void d'Herbert. A l'opposé du paysage urbain, véritable icône de la S-F, la nature sauvage n'est pas rationnellement thématisée. Elle révèle souvent les traits irrationnels des protagonistes et le retour d'impulsion primitifs dans une humanité très avancée techniquement. Le contact avec la nature produit chez le héros de vives prises de conscience et un dépassement des contraintes culturelles acceptées.

AB  - C'est un des rêves scientifiques récurrents de l'époque moderne que celui du Mouvement perpétuel et ce rêve prend chez Heinlein des formes très bizarres. En faisant opérer aux niveaux thématiques et structurels ce qu'il dénomme sa 'fabrique de fourrure à mouvement perpétuel', il nous rend témoins d'une convention des phénomènes de la vie organique et de leur logique évolutive dans le temps et l'espace en des schémas de processus circulaires qui à la fois s'auto-perpétuent et survivent en autarcie. La présente étude examine plusieurs récits d'Heinlein pour montrer que le schéma du Mouvement perpétuel opère au niveau thématique pour transformer certaines relations humaines fondamentales: la rivalité familiale entre mère, fils et père et le futur qui s'y engendre. Il en résulte un modèle qui s'oppose rigoureusement tant à celui de la psychologie jungienne qu'à celui de la mythologie: (1) le fils criconvient les courants de menace émanant de la figure maternelle et des peurs de la génération et neutralise l'élément féminin en douce exploitable de puissance, (2) le père à son tour se sert du fils comme agent pour exploiter l'élément féminin, détourne les promesses naturelles de croissance qui feraient du fils un individu capable de se substituer au patriarche et en réoriente l'énergie vers la protection de sa propre existence. Dominant ce paysage incestueux et cannibalesque, domine ainsi une figure de Chronos, engendrant et dévorant sa progéniture en vue de perpétuer sa vie vampirique dans le moment présent. L'étude examine, à des niveaux de plus en plus larges, les implications structurelles de ce modèle du Mouvement perpétuel: les tropes et les stratégies permettant à Heinlein des métamorphoser les types narratifs à orientation évolutive de la tradition littéraire occidentale en de ces structures autarciques et autosuffisantes analogues à la Famille-type d'Heinlein. L'essai propose enfin d'examiner à un niveau plus général encore ce que ce schéma peut impliquer pour la SF et pour la culture qui la produit. Il en vient à considérer ce paradoxe essentiel: le refus fondamental de l'avenir dans un genre qui se veut voué à l'exploration du futur.

AB  - En 1939 les nations capitalistes passaient de la Grande dépression à la Seconde guerre mondiale. La fission de l'atome avait été réalisée un an auparavant en Allemagne, les Martiens envahissaient le New-Jersey et Superman était apparu pour faire régner la Vérité, la Justice et la Manière de vivre américaine. Dans cette Amérique de trente-neuf, deux projections de l'avenir s'étaient manifestées dans Astounding SF et dans l'Exposition universelle surnommée 'Le Monde de Demain'. La vision de l'avenir offerte par ces deux sources se présentent dans une dialectique. L'abandon le plus béat aux blandices de la technologie se trouve, non dans Astounding, mais dans le 'Futurama' conçu par la General Motors, modèle de l'avenir en construction à ce moment-là. Le 'Futurama' incarne un avenir, monopoliste qui rend désuète l'aventure individualiste des magazines de SF et la démocratie sociale exaltée en d'autres endroits de l'Exposition.

AB  - L'extraterrestre en SF est une projection de l'Autre. Cependant, il est moins une représentation d'une différence radicale ou d'un inconnu véritable qu'il n'est une figure aliénée, un 'outsider' constitué comme tel dans un contexte historique donné. Dans les cas examinés dans l'essai où le contexte historique est celui des sociétés capitalistes anglaises et américaines, l'extraterrestre n'est pas essentiellement la métaphore du prolétariat industriel ou du tiers monde; il incarne certains traits de la conscience bourgeoise elle-même, il met à jour certaines pulsions secrètes et autonomes du sujet bourgeois dans son expérience de l'intériorité. Il reflète l'auto-aliénation par laquelle le corps devient la propriété fondamentale d'un individuelle, ce corps dont la force de travail et de plaisir les a administré comme 'force naturelle' virtuellement autonome par son propriétaire. Dans cette perspective on étudie divers récits de Mary Shelley, John W. Campbell et George Lucas (La Guerre des étoiles). La perception critique de l'aliénation remplit un rôle thématique essentiel dans Frankenstein. Le traitement de ce thème est plus limité par l'horizon idéologique de 'Who Goes There' mais dans La Guerre des étoiles, ce traitement est presque entièrement submergé par la nostalgie. A mesure que la S-F entre dans la culture de masse, l'allégorie de l'aliénation est de plus en plus subordonnée aux plaisirs réifiés de la consommation.

AB  - La présente étude se fonde sur une hypothèse relative aux présuppositions et à la vraisemblance narratives dans la mesure où celles-ci ne sont jamais immanentes au texte, mais toujours d'ordre intertextuel. Des différents types de vraisemblance, l'un joue un rôle hégémonique dans la société globale. L'approche intertextuelle permet une analyse des écrits qui s'écarte à la fois de l'idéologie conçue comme manipulation pragmatique ou d'une critique atomisée des 'influences' traitées dans un vacuum. En appliquant à l'étude de la SF victorienne les théories d'Angenot sur le 'Paradigme absent' et l'article de Wells 'Fiction about the Future', on voit le spectre des motifs S-F se présenter comme une sorte d'éventail déployé entre une base étroite d'optima et une large zone de pessima (voir figure). La S-F optimale emploie une logique narrative cohérente; l'interaction de l'univers de fiction et de l'univers empirique du lecteur détermine une zone de liberté. Les pessima du spectre S-F peuvent être simplement dus à l'incohérence ou à la banalité, au dogmatisme ou à l'invalidation du récit, c.-à-d. s'articuler aux intertextes du conte ou du récit réaliste banal (roman d'aventure ou d'amour), du modèle spéculatif conceptuel et de l'explication et des genres métaphysiques (fantastiques, p. ex.). Entre ces idéal-types, il y a des contaminations et les 'bons' récits de S-F peuvent se trouver d'ordinaire dans la zone intermédiaire entre les optima et pessima du genre. Les pessima se rangent sur la ligne de l'idéologie hégémonique, neutralisent le novum cognitif et invalident le paradigme fictionnelle de la différence radicale. A la base de la débilité si répandue en S-F on trouve cette réification de la littérature en marchandise, déjà présente dans la 1ère moitié du 19e siècle. Le phénomène est discuté en référence à Tocqueville, Poe et W. Benjamin. Dans la production et la diffusion de masse, l'authentique originalité signifiante (valeur d'usage) est récupérée par la répétition infinie de la circulation (valeur d'échange) dont le résultat est le sensationnalisme au goût du jour. Des occurrences ponctuelles se substituent aux continuités et cumulations de la valeur d'usage, à la manière des stratégies de jeux. Ce phénomène entraîne une nouvelle structure de sensibilité aux expériences fondamentales, comme celle du temps, perçue désormais comme démoniaque (ex. 'Maître Zacharias' de J. Verne). Une telle structure découle de l'expérience du client-consommateur fondée sur l'excitation. La seconde partie de l'article fait l'épreuve des hypothèses exposées ci-dessus sur des écrits de S-F publiés au Royaume-Uni entre 1848 et 1870; d'abord les récits de Poe; (2) dix-huit autres livres disposés en catégories narratives et idéologiques: prescriptions politiques et sociales (utopies et histoires futures), banalités dans la zone intermédiaire (Rowcroft et Lang) et, dans une catégorie à soi seul, le Voyage à la Lune de Trueman, où culmine la S-F britannique entre Shelley et Abbott. On utilise comme thèmes révélateurs de libération idéologique le traitement du rôle des femmes et les images du vol (de l'anti-gravité). L'ensemble des livres se polarise entre la communication du pouvoir et la communication du savoir. Les tendances hégémoniques cherchent à contenir le savoir ou à la dégrader en transformant le novum signifiant en pure et simple bizarrerie qui ne peut donner naissance à une parabole épistémique ou à un contre-projet politique. Les modèles narratifs, les idéologies et le destinataire social ont été pris en considération pour une connaissance pleine et entière de la S-F comme genre de masse.

AB  - En examinant 'Un cas de conscience: dossier de la correspondance', documents qui forment une partie du legs Blish à la Bibliothèque bodléienne, on peut voir comment Blish a gonflé sa nouvelle de 1953 pour en faire le livre de 1958. Ces données permettent de conclure, avec l'aide des deux versions publiées du récit, que Blish n'endosse pas totalement l'interprétation à laquelle aboutit son héros le Père Ruiz-Sanchez, à savoir que les extraterrestres lithiens et leur planète constituent un piège satanique (catégorie hérétique qui vient s'ajouter aux trois thèses établies par les Jésuites en ce qui touche aux êtres d'un autre monde par rapport au Christianisme). L'ambiguité est clairement voulue par Blish qui montre l'inadéquation des efforts visant à exonérer les Lithiens ou à lire le roman en termes pleinement chrétiens (ce, en dépit des nombreuses images chrétiennes éparses dans le récit), ou encore par l'équation établie dès le premier chapitre entre la conscience et un ornement amissible. Diverses images correlées de l'emballage et du conteneur qui à la fois protègent et isolent, traversent le roman. Si la conscience est une forme d'écran sociétal, elle n'offre pas de critérium certain, dès lors, pour juger du cas de Lithia et y distinguer l'apparence et la réalité, la surface qui dissimule et la vérité dissimulée. En fin de compte le savoir apparaît comme confondu avec l'acte de foi et l'intention de l'auteur, confondue avec le jeu déconstructif du langage.

AB  - 'The Iron Heel' a été lu plutôt comme un traité ou une prophétie historique que comme un roman. A cela tient la sous-évaluation de sa forme littéraire. Celle-ci est caractérisée, en premier lieu, par une stratification des voix-Ernest, Avis, Meredith-auxquelles correspondent des genres littéraires différents-essai, roman, historiographie-et des modes de perception différents. Ce procédé accentue les effets de persuasion du texte. D'autre part, entre les diverses couches de la narration et à l'intérieur du récit principal, se placent des interruptions et des silences, qui concernent à chaque fois des événements essentiels: la révolution socialiste, la mort du héros, l'insurrection du 'ghetto' prolétarien de Chicago. Ce paradigme qui place dans les silences les sujets fondamentaux, s'étend à la classe ouvrière et à l'usine: matériellement absentes, elles se constituent, pour cela même, comme centres symboliques du roman. L'absence de la classe ouvrière est couverte par la présence du parti révolutionnaire, surhomme collectif qui la remplace et la contrôle. Dans le texte s'établit enfin une connexion métaphorique entre la classe ouvrière et l'aspect matériel, corporel, instinctuel de la nature humaine. L'absence, le contrôle, la manipulation de la classe ouvrière renvoient donc à la disparition, à la manipulation, au contrôle du corps et des forces instinctuelles, fondement premier de l'image de lui-même que le Parti présente à la classe.

AB  - Dans son livre 'Utopiques': Jeux d'espaces (1973), Louis Marin donne une analyse nouvelle et puissante du fonctionnement de l'imagination utopique. Se servant des idées d'Ernst Bloch, de Maurice Blanchot et de Claude Lévi-Strauss, Marin explique comment les représentations utopiques indiquent l'espace vide où doit apparaître une théorie scientifique de la société avant qu'une telle théorie puisse exister. Loin d'être un vrai plan politique à mettre en exécution, une utopie désoriente les éléments d'un univers de discours donné pour préparer l'avènement de quelque chose d'inconcevable et d'indicible dans ce discours. Après une étude détaillée de l'Utopie de Thomas More, Marin examine quelques 'utopies' de nos jours-dont la ville cosmique de Xenakis émerge comme la plus réussie.

AB  - La logique anti-utopique, caractéristique d'H.G. Wells dans son oeuvre antérieure à 1900, se montre sceptique quant aux résolutions stables des contradictions et se plaît à explorer celles-ci. La logique utopique (qui comprend la dystopique) vise la cohérence et la résolution des antagonismes conceptuesl. Dans son Quand le dormeur s'éveillera, 1899, Wells cherche à mettre aux prises ces deux modes antithétiques. Nous de Zamyatine est purement anti-utopique. Le 1984 d'Orwell, Fahrenheit 451 de Bradbury, et Brave New World de Huxley laissent apparaître diverses formes de cohérence utopique. Enfin, l'Utopie moderne de Wells lui-même, quoique essentiellement utopique, montre des traces identifiables de logique anti-utopique.

KW  - ideology
AB  - Ernst Bloch et Herbert Marcuse ont identifié les opérations de l'expression utopique comme faisant partie de cette activité humaine qui consiste à imaginer, et dès lors à désirer, une façon de vivre autre que celle que procure le système social en vigueur. Le désir utopique s'exprime par des 'figures d'espérance' littéraires qui préfigurent des structures de relations humaines et des activités que l'histoire n'a pas encore réalisées. Cependant, l'utopie ne doit pas s'entendre comme un simple plan spéculatif qui s'opposerait à la réalité historique. Au contraire, l'utopie doit se comprendre comme rivale de l'idéologie, ainsi que, le premier, Karl Mannheim l'a définie. L'Utopie présente un défi à l'idéologie dominante du système social établi. Les écrits utopiques font partie de cette opposition à la société de 'contrôle total'. C'est ici que les travaux de Gramsci, d'Althusser, de Foucault et d'Harry Braverman nous permettent de comprendre les opérations de contre-hégémonie qui résistent aux mécanismes totalitaires et dégradants du capitalisme moderne et des bureaucraties centralisées et les subvertissent. Ainsi, les travaux de Jürgen Habermas, d'Oskar Negt et d'Alexander Kluge identifient l'opposition à la sphère publique bourgeoise à une sphère publique plébéienne d'opposition, lieu de résistance à notre présent radicalement décevant. Les écritures utopiques critiques peuvent dont être lues comme l'expression d'un désir engendré à l'intérieur de la sphère publique oppositionnelle, alternative imaginative à l'idéologie dominante.

AB  - Le Chili n'a pu prétendre à une SF indigène avant 1959. Cette année-là a vu paraître le premier ouvrage d'Hugo Correa qui demeure le plus prolifique et le meilleur écrivain de SF chilien à ce jour. Los Altissimos, le premier de ses cinq romans, passe pour un 'classique', excellent début d'un 'Âge d'or' de la SF au Chili. On a ensuite l'oeuvre d'Antonio Montero Abt, avec trois titres à son crédit spécialement Acá del tiempo, 1969. Montero semble avoir cessé d'écrire après 1970 et plus personne d'un talent comparable ne s'est voué exclusivement à la SF depuis lors. Un écrivain de littérature canonique, Miguel Arteche a daigné une fois passer à la SF d'anticipation avec El Cristo Hueco, 1969. Parmi les livres des années soixante, ceux d'Armando Menedin, Elena Aldurate Bezanilla et Ilda Cádiz Avila méritent mention, quoique ces auteurs n'aient écrit que peu et sous forme de nouvelles. Dans les années 70, on mentionne Carlos Ruiz-Tagle et José Bohr, ce dernier avec son livre Mañana hacia el ayer, 1975. Enfin on signalera, par acquit de conscience, la SF exécrable de Roberto von Bennewitz et René Peri Fagerstrom. L''Âge d'or' chilien n'a pas duré: il s'achève avec le coup d'État contre Allende en 1975: depuis lors, la production de SF dans ce pays a virtuellement cessé. /// Chile could not lay claim to any indigenous SF until 1959. That year, however, marked the first appearance in print of Hugo Correa, who remains the most prolific as well as the best writer of SF that Chile has so far produced. Los Altissimos (The Superiors, 1959), his first book (of five, to date) is something of a classic, certainly an auspicious beginning to a 'Golden Age' of Chilean SF. Second to Correa is Antonio Montero Abt, with three SF titles to his credit- most notably, Acá del tiempo (This Side of Time, 1969). But Montero apparently ceased writing after 1970, and no one else of talent among his compatriots has since devoted her or himself to writing SF exclusively and in quantity. There is, perhaps predictably, one renowned 'mainstream' author, Miguel Arteche, who momentarily condescended to an S-F future history, El Cristo hueco (The Empty Christ, 1969). And among the SF books of the '60s, those of Armando Menedin, Elena Aldunate Bezanilla, and Ilda Cádiz Ávila deserve mention, even though they have written little and that little entirely in the form of short fictions. So, too, among '70s' writers, Carlos Ruiz-Tagle and José Bohr can be singled out, especially the latter for his Mañana hacia el ayer (Tomorrow Towards Yesterday, 1975). And finally, just for the record, there also exist some execrable SF stories by Roberto von Bennewitz and René Peri Fagerstrom. Chile's 'Golden Age' has proved to be short-lived: it lasted until about the time of Allende's overthrow-until 1975, to be precise-since which time SF activity in the country has virtually come to a complete halt.

AB  - Une comparaison des romans d'Olaf Stapledon (en particulier de son livre Last and First Men et de Star Maker) avec ceux d'André Malraux, notamment La Condition humaine, fait apparaître une conscience essentiellement narrative qui opère chez les deux écrivains. Une perception dialectique de la relation entre l'activité humaine et le potentiel humain est centrale dans cette conscience historique. Cette conscience voit les événements comme significatifs dans la mesure seulement où ils sont mesurés à une vision plus vaste de ce que l'être humain a été et de ce qu'il peut devenir. C'est pourquoi Malraux enracine son roman dans un moment historique particulier en vue de suggérer que la réponse appropriée à la 'condition humaine' éternelle de souffrance inévitable et de mort ne se trouve pas dans l'innocence mythique de l'idéologie, pas plus que dans une résignation passive à la tragédie humaine, mais dans une lucidité plus grande que jamais de la part de l'humanité en ce qui touche à ce qu'elle est capable d'accomplir dans les limites naturelles qui lui posent des contraintes. De la même façon, mais sur un canevas incomparablement plus vaste, Stapledon met à l'épreuve la même capacité des hommes de conférer de la signification à l'histoire de l'humanité. Du reste, c'est la conscience historique de Stapledon qui explique en partie des éléments aussi caractéristiques de sa fiction que le narrateur comme observateur distancé, la formule d'intrigue de la situation extrême et le thème de la personnalité-dans-la-communauté. /// A comparison of Olaf Stapledon's fictions (especially Last and First Men and Star Maker) with André Malraux's Man's Fate discloses an essentially narrative consciousness at work in both writers. Central to this historical consciousness is a dialectical awareness of the relationship between human actuality and human potentiality-an awareness that present events are meaningful only as they are measured against a larger vision of what human beings have been and what they can become. Malraux accordingly steeps his novel in a particular historical moment to suggest that the appropriate response to the eternal condition humaine of inevitable suffering and death lies not in the mythic innocence of ideology or in a passive resignation to human tragedy, but in an ever greater lucidity on the part of humanity about what it is capable of within the natural limits that constrain it. So, too-but using an incomparably larger canvas than Malraux-Stapledon tests this same human capability for giving significance to human history. Indeed, it is Stapledon's historical consciousness that accounts, in part, for such characteristic elements of his fiction as the distancing narrator, the extreme-situation plot device, and the personality-in-community theme.

AB  - Le roman anti-utopique de Y. Zamyatine, Nous, s'appuie sur une conception romantique de la politique et de la technologie qui est en harmonie avec les positions exposées par l'auteur dans divers essais datant des premières années de l'État soviétique. Dans le roman, les images de la machine tout autant qu'une adaptation du mythe de Prométhée font apparaître la capacité que possèdent les produits de l'imagination humaine de devenir des éléments inhibant l'activité imaginatrice même. Ainsi, la machine et l'État sont à la fois les libérateurs potentiels de l'homme et ses maîtres réels. Le drame se réalise dans l'esprit de D-503 dont le désir instinctif de liberté et d'individualité est finalement détruit le laissant dans un état parfaitement mécanique auquel consciemment, il n'a jamais cessé d'aspirer. En ce sens, D-503 vient à représenter l'échec de l'imagination à conserver son ascendant sur ses propres créations. /// Yevgeny Zamyatin's anti-utopian novel We relies on a Romantic conception of politics and technology that is consistent with attitudes developed in essays Zamyatin wrote during the early years of the Bolshevik state. In the novel, both the machine images and the adaptation of the Prometheus myth demonstrate the capacity of the products of the imagination to become inhibitors of imaginative activity: thus the machine and the state are at once man's potential liberators and his actual masters. The drama is played out in the mind of D-503, whose instinctive desire for freedom and individuality is eventually destroyed, leaving him in the perfectly mechanical state towards which he has always consciously aspired. In this sense, D-503 comes to represent the failure of the imagination to retain its ascendancy over its creations.

AB  - Paul Scheerbart (1863-1915) est un cas étrange parmi les écrivains d'imagination: Prussien doté d'un sens de l'humour, il a créé un cosmos en transformation et en altération constantes et colorées, univers de fiction qui est sans paralléle dans l'histoire. Préoccupé de contenus nouveaux-avec de curieux extraterrestres, des étoiles dotées de sens, des paysages du lointain univers, avec d'autres architectures, spécialement de verre, et de nouvelles formes d'art-Scheerbart s'intéressait surtout à des problémes d'esthétique. Les formes et les genres littéraires canoniques subissent entre les mains une condensation, une simplification radicale qui ont pour effet de les ironiser. Les lois ordinaires de la physique ne régissent pas son monstrueusement bizarre univers. Il ridiculise ces lois prétendues qui ne sont à ses yeux que les médiocres produits des vers de terre que nous sommes, imposés aux êtres astraux inaccessibles à la raison humaine, êtres dont les sympathies et les métamorphoses sans but ne servent d'autre fin que de produire des visions toujours autres et neuves des espaces cosmiques infinis. Scheerbart se proclamait amoureux de l' 'esprit du monde'. Cela est sans doute vrai, mais cet amour confère à cet univers esthétique un caractère curieusement statique et sans âme. Son cosmos est en fait une pure construction littéraire. Pacifique, dépourvu des contraintes du travail, de la survie, des douleurs résultant des conflits et des déceptions sexuels, il se présente comme un contre-univers dont le monde réel et la Terre retenues par les lois de la gravité figurent l'absolue antithèse. /// Paul Scheerbart (1863-1915) is a most singular phenomenon among fantasts: a Prussian gifted with a sense of humor, he created a cosmos of the most colorful continuous transformations and alterations-a cosmos that is without parallel in literary history. Despite being evidently preoccupied with new contents-with curious alien beings, including sentient stars, with landscapes in the far universe, with other architectures (especially of glass), and with new art forms-Scheerbart was most interested in aesthetic problems. Accepted literary forms and genres in his hands undergo a condensation, an uttermost simplification, which has the effect of ironizing them. Nor do the conventional laws of physics rule his monstrously bizarre cosmos. Indeed, he held such laws in ridicule, claiming that they were nothing more than what the poor imagination of 'earthworms' imposed upon higher, astral beings inaccessible to human reason-beings whose sympathies and ultimately aimless metamorphoses serve no goal other than to produce ever 'new' and 'other' vistas of the incredibly wide cosmic spaces. Scheerbart proclaimed that he was in love with the 'world spirit.' That is no doubt true enough, but his attachment to it gives his aesthetic universe of surface form a curiously soulless and static quality. His cosmos is in fact a purely literary construct. Pacifist and free from the drudgery of work, the necessity for food, and the pains of sexual conflicts and disappointments, it stands as a counter-world, implicitly invoking the real world, Earth bound in the fetters of terrestrial gravity, only as its absolute antithesis.

AB  - L'étendue et la force de la métafiction, et surtout de la SF moderne, de cette aventure intellectuelle qui pourrait s'appeler la 'subversion cognitive', doit beaucoup à notre compréhension croissante du langage. La construction des langues artificielles, l'informatique, l'exploration des systèmes cognitifs et de la cybernétique, mènent à une littérature qui exploite les rapports entre les systèmes sémiotiques humains, 'naturels', et les autres artificiels, 'non-naturels'. Pour faciliter notre compréhension de ces derniers je propose une première classification. On y trouve deux grands ensembles, lexématique et non-lexématique. L'ensemble un (lexématique) comprend les catégories suivantes: (1) signifiant (sa) dont le signifié (sé) (2) sa avec un seul sé (langue machine); (3) sa dont le sé obéit à des règles logiques (cybernétique); (4) sa dont le sé est réévalué (contexte futur, parallèle). L'ensemble deux (non lexématique) inclut ces catégories-ci: (5) sa composé (mots-valise, techno-néologismes); (6) sa modifié (dérivés, extrapolation, langues futures); (7) sa 'arbitraire' (exolinguistique), pour la plupart signe motivé, icône (motivation phonétique, visuelle ou anagrammatique, p.ex.). L'utilisation du signifiant arbitraire dépend d'habitude de l'insertion d'un signe motivé dans un système sémiotique propre au monde du texte, le 'paradigme absent' de Marc Angenot. Il nous importe de comprendre le fonctionnement de ces divers signifiants et les rapports des langues 'naturelles' et 'non-naturelles' dans l'agencement du texte SF qui dépend des deux systèmes secondaires barthésiens, connotation et métalangue. /// The extent and force of metafiction, and especially of modern SF-of that intellectual adventure which could be called 'cognitive subversion'-owes much to an increasing understanding of language. The construction of artificial languages, the exploration of knowledge systems and of cybernetics, and information theory generally all lead to a literature which exploits the connections between human, or 'natural,' semiotic systems and others which are artificial, or 'unnatural.' To facilitate our comprehension of the latter, I would propose a preliminary scheme of classification based in two large groupings: leximatic and non-leximatic. The leximatic group comprises the following categories: (1) the signifier whose signified is absent (missing, empty); (2) the signifier having a single signified (as in computer language, at least ideally); (3) the signifier whose signified obeys logical rules (as in cybernetics); and (4) the signifier whose signified is re-evaluated by its context (future, parallel, or whatnot). The non-leximatic group includes these categories: (5) the compact signifier (as in portmanteau words, techno-neologisms, etc.); (6) the modified signifier (derived through extrapolation from future languages); and (7) the 'arbitrary,' or exolinguistic, signifier, for the most part a sign or icon whose motivation is, say, phonetic, visual, or anagrammatic. (The use of the arbitrary signifier usually depends on the insertion of a 'motivated' sign into a semiotic system peculiar to the world of the text-depends, that is, on what Marc Angenot calls the 'absent paradigm.') How these diverse signifiers function and what they can tell us about the relationships between 'natural' and 'unnatural' languages as they figure in SF texts are questions best approached through Roland Barthes' concepts of connotation and metalanguage, from the standpoint of which the capacity of fiction to transform and reinterpret chains of signification is most apparent.

AB  - 'The Persistence of Vision' de John Varley offre une utopie linguistique où le langage ordinaire, composé de signes caractérisés par un élément de distance et d'absence, est remplacé par un langage où le procès de signification est court-circuité en faveur d'une 'lecture directe' de ce monde même. Varley conscient du fait qu'un tel langage in praesentia est incompatible avec les structures de notre monde, en sépare son utopie. La séparation est légère au départ et le récit reste dans les limites du vraisemblable, mais à la fin Varley ne permet pas de douter du fait que son histoire est un conte merveilleux où les données sont impossibles et non destinées à être crues. Cette invraisemblance importe car si nous devions croire que le texte impose une lecture directe ou allégorique, ses récits apparaîtraient soit auto-destructeurs d'une part, soit vainement prétentieux de l'autre. Ce récit qui d'abord communique l'apparence d'une foi absolue dans la possibilité d'une forme parfaite de communication se démasque à la fin pour montrer que ce langage onirique ne peut exister que dans un domaine de radicale fantaisie. /// John Varley's 'The Persistence of Vision' proposes a linguistic utopia in which ordinary speech, which is composed of signs inevitably possessing an element of distance and 'absence,' is replaced by a language (or set of languages) in which the process of signification is set aside in favor of the direct 'reading' of the world. Since Varley is fully aware that such a language of presence is incompatible with the structure of the world we live in, he separates his utopia from this world. The separation is at first relatively slight, and the story stays close to the margins of credibility; but at the end Varley leaves no doubt that his tale is a magical fantasy treating a world very different from the one we inhabit. What happens in Varley's story is impossible and not to be believed. This impossibility and this incredibility are precisely the point, for if we were to suppose that Varley meant to solicit the reader's belief, either directly or allegorically, his story would appear either curiously self-destructive on the one hand or emptily pretentious on the other. Neither is the case. This story that at first gives every appearance of expressing absolute faith in the possibility of a perfect form of communication unmasks itself at the end by showing decisively that this dream-language can exist only in the realm of outright, incredible fantasy. The language of this fantasy world is shown to be most powerful precisely when it is most incredible.

AB  - La revue 'Fiction' était loin d'être simplement l'édition française de 'The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction.' A partir de la date de fondation en 1953, et au cours des six premières années, les rédacteurs cherchaient à identifier ce qui déterminait la science-fiction française et ce qu'elle pourrait devenir. Puisque la 'science-fiction' n'existait pas en tant que telle en France, les rédacteurs de 'Fiction' tentèrent de définir cette forme par rapport à d'autres genres reconnus par la tradition: le fantastique, l'étrange et le mystère. D'abord, le résultat fut une définition sophistiquée du genre sans égal à l'époque (même dans les pays anglo-saxons). Ensuite, il en découla également une notion très particulière et traditionnelle de ce qu'est cette science-fiction française, c'est-à-dire une littérature qui n'explore pas l'avenir ou les mondes lointains mais qui sonde les mondes parallèles intérieurs en cherchant le mystère de l'univers matériel dans les recoins de l'imagination de l'esprit humain plutôt que sur d'autres planètes. Cet essai traite surtout du travail de deux critiques de la première équipe de 'Fiction', Jean-Jacques Bridenne et Gérard Klein. Dans les premiers numéros de la revue, Bridenne écrit une série d'essais par lesquels il tente de dégager une véritable tradition française de la science-fiction. Par la suite, Klein analyse l'œuvre de certains 'maîtres' américains contemporains de la SF à la lumière de cette même tradition française qu'il est en train de définir. De ces premiers numéros, une science-fiction s'ensuit dont la forme est fondamentalement cartésienne et surréaliste. Cette forme littéraire construit le rêve par la raison et cet acte paradoxal vise à préserver le privilège du cogito face à un univers sujet au terreur du nombre et de l'infiniment vide. /// 'Fiction' was far from being simply the French version of 'The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction'. Over the half-dozen odd years from its outset in 1953, the editors of the former sought to identify what French SF peculiarly was-and could be. This process of definition involved placing SF in relation to categories traditionally recognized by French culture: the fantastic, the uncanny, 'mystery fiction.' The result was both a sense of generic function without equivalent in the Anglo-Saxon SF world at the time and a very particular, and traditional, sense of what SF is: a literature that explores alternate and parallel, rather than other, worlds; a literature that turns away from expansive paradigms to explore the inner world of the imagining organ-the rational mind itself. To follow this process of definition step by step, this essay focuses on the work of two early 'Fiction' critics: Jean-Jacques Bridenne and Gérard Klein. Bridenne seeks, in the early issues, to establish the nature of the French SF tradtion by bringing to light a series of native precursors. Building on the direction this lineage sets, Klein analyzes the work of a number of new American 'masters' in the light of a gradually forming French sense of the SF genre. As Klein comes ultimately to define it, this SF is Cartesian and surrealist in nature. Which means that it seeks a logical cultivation of dream worlds. And should do so in hopes of preserving the privilege of the cogito in relation to a material universe otherwise defined by Pascal's two infinities.

AB  - A la fin de la deuxième guerre mondiale, la France s'est lancée dans un processus de modernisation afin de reconquérir sa place de grande puissance mondiale. De 1951 à 1960, des centaines de romans de la collection 'Anticipation' de Fleuve Noir témoignent de multiples prises de position face à cette révolution technocratique sans précédent. Deux seulement des onze auteurs français qui collaborèrent à cette série offrent des vues qui entérinent le système technocratique. François Richard et Henri Bessière, s'inspirant de Saint-Simon et utilisant le pseudonyme de F. Richard-Bessière, présentent l'ordre technocratique comme un paradigme idéal. Quatre autres auteurs du Fleuve Noir acceptent pleinement les postulats de Richard-Bessière mais s'écartent d'eux par le détail. M.A. Rayjean remet en question les priorités technocratiques. Stéfan Wul aimerait voir un chef du type 'De Gaulle' superviser l'élite dirigeante et il revaloriserait les formes traditionnelles de pensé. Cependant, Kurt Steiner et Jimmy Guieu insistent sur le facteur biologique de l'évolution vers la technocratie. Leurs visions s'apparentent quelque peu à certaines positions d'Olaf Stapledon et de J.D. Bernal. Dans le cas de Guieu, l'image futuriste de savants dégageant le cerveau d'êtres humains de son enveloppe corporelle en vue de la préservation de l'espèce est pour le moins ambivalente. Un troisième groupe se dresse plus ou moins rigoureusement contre la technocratie ou contre certaines de ses conséquences. Kemmel met en doute la sagesse de l'élite scientifique en ce qui concerne les prises de décision pratiques. Maurice Limat fait valoir la position religieuse traditionnelle qui s'oppose aux bases philosophiques de la technocratie. Jean-Gaston Vandel et B.R. Bruss entrevoient difficilement l'inégalité et l'oppression issues de tout schéma technocratique. Peter Randa sous-entend qu'en pratique toute forme d'organisation sociale est hostile à l'individualisme radical qu'il prône. Finalement, Gérard Klein se trouve dans une catégorie à part et il fait le contrepoint à Richard-Bessière. Le seul récit qu'il ait écrit pour 'Anticipation' pendant la décennie en question se lit, dans un premier temps, comme une apologie du système technocratique. Mais une relecture minutieuse révèle que Les chirurgiens d'une planète parodie un tel concept. De plus, le roman de Klein est peut-être une satire de la formule même du Fleuve Noir supposant que les exigences et les attentes de la série 'Anticipation' écartent toute position alternative à la vision technocratique. /// Following World War II, France embarked on a process of modernization designed to restore its place as a first-class power. The novels original to Fleuve Noir's 'Collection Anticipation' for the years 1951-60-and there were hundreds of them-reflect a diversity of attitudes towards this unprecedented technocratic revolution. Among the 11 French authors who wrote books for this series, only two offer visions pretty much wholeheartedly approving of technocracy. Inspired by Saint-Simon and under the pseudonym of F. Richard-Bessière, François Richard and Henri Bessière represent the technocratic order as an ideal paradigm. Four other Fleuve Noir authors largely accept Richard-Bessière's assumptions, but dissent from them in regard to specifics. M.A. Rayjean questions technocratic priorities; and Stefan Wul would put a De Gaulle-like leader above the managerial elite and revolorize traditional ways of thinking. Kurt Steiner and Jimmy Guieu, meanwhile, emphasize the biological side of an evolution towards technocracy. Their visions somewhat resemble certain of Olaf Stapledon's or J.D. Bernal's (though in Guieu's case, an ambivalence attaches to the futuristic picture of scientists disincorporating the brains of other human beings to preserve the species). A third group more or less adamantly opposes technocracy or some of its consequences. Kemmel doubts the wisdom of a scientific elite in matters of practical decision-making; Maurice Limat takes a traditional religious stand against technocracy's philosophical basis; Jean-Gaston Vandel and B.R. Bruss have problems with the inequality and oppressiveness of any technocratic scheme of things; and Peter Randa suggests that virtually any form of social organization is inimical to the radical kind of individualism that he favors. Finally, in a class by himself and counterpointing Richard-Bessière, we have Gérard Klein. The one book he wrote for 'Anticipation' during the period covered at first reads like an apology for technocratism. But careful examination suggests that Les chirurgiens d'une planète may well be a deliberate parody of such a rationale. Furthermore, Klein's novel is perhaps also satirizing the Fleuve Noir formula itself, implying that the demands and expectations of the 'Anticipation' series preclude any vision truly alternative to a technocratic one.

AB  - Après l'activité intense de la fin des années 70, la SF française s'est écartée du politique pour se pencher sur des questions esthétiques. Les membres de cette nouvelle tendance ont modifié les frontières du genre mais n'y ont guère gagné de lecteurs. Il existe toujours un courant prospére de SF populaire. Cependant les auteurs les plus intéressants de la SF français demeurent isolés, les plus anciens se tenant en retrait et les nouveaux aux prises avec des problèmes de débouchés. La surprenante popularité de Serge Brussolo relève plus de l'horreur que de la SF. /// After the intense activity of the late '70s, French SF has moved away from political concerns to center on œsthetic questions. Exponents of this new trend changed the genre's boundaries but have not met with much public acceptance. A thriving current of pulp SF still exists. However, the more interesting French SF writers remain isolated, the older ones in retreat, the younger ones hampered by market conditions. Serge Brussolo's surprising success pertains more to the horror genre than to SF.

AB  - Le but de cet article est double: établir une théorie de la paranoïa et montrer la pertinence d'une telle théorie pour la SF en général et pour l'oeuvre de Philip K. Dick en particulier. Les réflexions diverses de Freud sur la paranoïa, spécialement dans la Lecture du Président Schreber, suggèrent que celle-ci opère selon une logique herméneutique sans faille. Le paranoïaque interprète tous les phénomènes de ce monde comme les aspects d'une totalité expressive symétrique au centre de laquelle se place le moi du paranoïaque lui-même. Jacques Lacan accepte cette thèse et y adjoint deux révisions importantes. Il montre d'abord que la paranoïa n'est pas purement et simplement une maladie mais qu'elle est de façon cruciale paradigmatique du développement psychique normal. En deuxième lieu, il cherche à historiciser les catégories fondamentales de la psychoanalyse et à montrer que le sujet freudien et le sujet de l'ère capitaliste sont inextricablement liés. Si dès lors, la paranoïa est de certaine façon la subjectivité normative de la société capitaliste, il faut demander ce qu'il y a dans le capitalisme qui requiert une herméneutique constante. Deux réponses se présentent, en particulier en ce qui a trait au capitalisme de consommation ou monopoliste: au plan économique, la marchandise; au plan politique, la conspiration. Marx lui-même dans sa théorie du fétichisme de la marchandise, identifie la marchandise comme un signifiant mystificateur qui requiert l'interprétation. La conspiration n'a jamais été rigoureusement théorisée mais il est au moins provisoirement plausible de la regarder comme un trait structurel de la vie politique sous le capitalisme monopoliste américain. C'est un lieu commun de dire que Dick est un écrivain paranoïde dans le sens que ses personnages sont des anti-héros paranoïaques en général. On a moins remarqué la précision et la cohérence avec lesquelles Dick représente les objets d'angoisse du paranoïaque et son herméneutique comme marchandises et intersignes d'une conspiration. CF présente ici de nombreux exemples à l'appui de cette thèse, montrant notamment comment Dick 'littéralise' la structure métaphorique qu'emploie Marx pour théoriser le fétichisme de la marchandise. Il y a, plus généralement, une relation privilégiée entre la SF et l'idéologie paranoïaque, à la fois dans le principe de distanciation de la SF et dans certaines tendances littéraires du genre. L'article conclut sur une lecture d'Ubik où les thèses ci-dessus apparaissent le plus nettement. /// This essay has a twofold aim: to outline a theory of paranoia, and to demonstrate the relevance of this theory to SF in general and to the work of Philip K. Dick in particular. Freud's various remarks on paranoia-most notably in his reading of Schreber-suggest that paranoia operates by a ruthlessly hermeneutic logic. The paranoiac interprets all worldly phenomena as aspects of a symmetrical and expressive totality at the center of which stands the 'I' of the paranoiac himself. Jacques Lacan accepts this model but adds two important revisions. First, he demonstrates that paranoia is not merely a disease but is in crucial ways paradigmatic of 'normal' human psychic development. Second, he attempts to historicize the basic categories of psychoanalysis and to show that the Freudian subject and the subject of the capitalist epoch are inextricably related. If, then, paranoia is in a sense the normative subjectivity of capitalist society, it must be asked what there is in capitalism that demands constant hermeneutic. Two answers present themselves, especially in the context of 20th-century consumerist or monopoly capitalism: on the economic level, the commodity; on the political level, conspiracy. Marx himself, in the theory of commodity fetishism, identifies the commodity as a mystifying signifier that demands interpretation. Conspiracy has never been rigorously theorized, but it is at least provisionally plausible to regard it as a structural feature of political life under American monopoly capitalism. It is a commonplace that Dick is a paranoid writer in the sense that his protagonists are generally paranoiac anti-heroes. What has been less widely noted is the precision and consistency with which he represents the objects of paranoid worrying and hermeneutic as commodities and signs of conspiracy. Here I offer many examples drawn from a variety of Dick's texts, especially emphasizing the degree to which he literalizes the kind of metaphoric structure that Marx employs in theorizing commodity fetishism. Though Dick may be pre-eminent in this regard, there is, however, a generally privileged relationship between SF and paranoiac ideology, both in the estranging assumptions of SF and in certain literary tendencies of the genre toward totalization and logical coherence. I conclude with a reading of Ubik, wherein the connection of paranoia with commodities and conspiracies is perhaps most fully worked out, but which also may suggest a critique of paranoia and a demonstration of its ideological limits.

KW  - film
AB  - La nouveauté de 'Blade Runner' (1982) ne réside pas dans ses aspects techniques mais dans sa perspective visuelle. Dans ce film, Ridley Scott nous offre quelque chose de presque unique dans le cinéma de SF (quoique approché parfois dans le 2001 de Kubrick et dans la scéne de bar galactique de La guerre des Étoiles de Lucas): la vision d'un milieu social complet. BR contribue au cinéma de SF en établissant un champ de vision unifié qui inclut le fait social. Ce que Scott a accompli est à de certains égards comparable à l'ouverture de vedute-de ces 'fenêtres' englobant une unité et continuité spatiales- dans la peinture de la Renaissance. Mais, en plein contraste avec le schéma classique d'ordre hiérarchique et vertical maximal, BR suit un principe d'ordre minimal, de représentation 'horizontale' de la société. Cela s'accorde bien au réalisme 'primaire' pour lequel Scott a un évident penchant. Il nous montre le triste et sordide Los Angeles de 2019, monde qui dans son désordre quasi-médiéval fait penser au Hong-Kong d'aujourd'hui et qui fait penser aussi, par sa juxtaposition d'un 'zoo humain' avec la belle vie résidentielle de l'élite technocratique, à certaines mégapoles américaines modernes. Il nous permet d'inférer aussi, par des références au Nord encore vierge, au bonsaî et aux statues du blade runner etc., que juste à côté ou au-dessus de ce monde de Zola ou de Hammett, il y a celui de Proust ou de Fitzgerald. La valeur visuelle révolutionnaire de BR est cependant confirmée à ce qu'il en vient à aborder la dimension politique. En montrant le paysage social, Scott omet le souci traditionnel du cinéaste: la mise en scène des pouvoirs et des luttes pour le pouvoir. Plutôt que de trouver un moyen narratif pour faire saisir la conscience psychopolitique adéquate à sa nouvelle peinture du social, Scott régresse vers les formules usées de la littérature à sensation ou du roman policier et offre, en la personne même du Blade Runner, un stéréotype de bande dessinée plutôt qu'un individu plausible. C'est pourquoi si le cinéma de SF veut réaliser son potentiel comme nouveau genre, le type de vision sociale que BR atteint n'est pas suffisant: il nous faut un réalisateur avec les capacités d'un Tolstoî et l'ampleur ambitieuse d'un Guerre et paix. /// The novelty of 'Blade Runner' (1982) does not reside in its technical aspects but in its visual perspective. In his latest film, Ridley Scott gives us something almost unique in SF cinema (though it is adumbrated-barely-in Kubrick's 2001 and in the galactic barroom scene in Lucas's Star Wars): a vision of a complete social milieu. What is original to 'Blade Runner' as a contribution to SF film is the establishing of a unified field of vision which takes in the social. Scott's achievement is in a way comparable to the opening of vedute-of 'windows' evincing a spatial oneness and continuity-in Renaissance and Neoclassical (portrait) painting. But in contrast to the Classical scheme of hierarchical, or vertical-and hence maximum-order, 'Blade Runner' follows the principle of minimal ordering, or horizontal representation, in exhibiting society. This sorts well with the 'grass-roots realism' that Scott evidently has a penchant for. He shows us the sad and sordid Los Angeles of 2019, a world which in its nearly medieval disorder resembles present-day Hong Kong and also, in its juxtaposition of a swarming and ghettoized 'human zoo' with the skyscraper existence of a managerial elite, some modern American megalopolis. At the same time, he allows us to infer, through references to the still-virgin North, to the blade runner's bonsai and statues, and so forth, that right next to-or rather, above-this world of Zola or Hammett, as it were, is that of Proust or Fitzgerald. 'Blade Runner's' visual revolutionariness is confined to what it represents, without extending to how it does so. Moreover, the film falters, almost fatally, when it comes to dealing with the political dimension of its vision of society. In showing the social, Scott neglects the traditional concern of SF cinema (though also something which keeps it in the throes of utopian totalitarianism): the staging of power (and power struggles). Rather than discovering a narrative vehicle adequate for conveying a psycho-political awareness commensurate with his novel depiction of the social, Scott regresses to the formulas of the thriller or detective fiction and offers, particularly in the person of the blade runner, a comic-strip stereotype rather than a psychologically plausible human being. If SF is to realize its potential as a new film genre, the kind of social view that 'Blade Runner' affords is not enough: what is needed is a director with Tolstoy's abilities, and a film with the ambition of War and Peace.

AB  - 'La Vie sur Epsilon' (paru en 1972) est le cinquième livre du cycle fictionnel de Claude Ollier. Les huit volumes du Jeu d'enfant datent de 1958 à 1975 et comportent une méditation active sur la nature et le fonctionnement de la fiction. Avec ce cinquième livre, le cycle dérive sur une planète lointaine et devient une 'science' de la fiction qui cherche à discerner ses propres lois et mécanismes. Sur une planète de sable et de neige, quatre astronautes naufragés cherchent à se sauver en décélant des lois qui régissent ce paysage inconnu. Leurs investigations prennent la forme d'une randonnée aveugle dans un vaste livre, et la topographie insolite d'Epsilon devient aussitôt une typographie qui déroute et inquiète O., le chef de l'expédition. Ce qui fait peur à l'astronaute est la féminité terrifiante de ce texte/planète: tantôt vierge, tantôt archi-codée, la planète refuse de se laisser 'lire', de se laisser comprendre par O. Elle absorbe toutes ces marques, y compris son vaisseau spatial. La menace que comporte cette textualité rebelle est la castration. Dans cette allégorie lointaine, le 'protagoniste de toujours' se voit menacé par une textualité futuriste qui lui refuse tous ses privilèges traditionnels: la centralité, l'ordre, le sens. Dans cet essai, l'auteur arpente le paysage du roman de science-fiction tel que le conçoit un romancier expérimental contemporain. /// The eight volumes of Claude Ollier's fictional cycle, Jeu d'enfant, were published between 1958 and 1975 and together comprise an active meditation on the nature and function of fiction. 'La vie sur Epsilon' (1972), the fifth book in the series, moves the cycle to a distant planet and becomes a 'science' of fiction which seeks self-consciousness of its own laws and mechanisms. On a planet of sand and snow, four stranded astronauts attempt to save themselves by discovering the laws which govern this unknown world (of Epsilon). Their investigations take the form of a blindly random journey in a vast book, as the strange topography of Epsilon becomes also a typography which confounds and disquiets O., the leader of the expedition. What frightens him is the terrifying femininity of this text/planet. In part virgin, in part master-code, the planet refuses to let itself be 'read' or comprehended by O. It absorbs all inscriptions, including the astronauts' spaceship itself. The menace which this subversive textuality holds is that of castration. In this far-flung allegory, the traditional protagonist sees himself threatened by a futurist textuality which denies him all his traditional privileges: centrality, order, sense. It is this terrain as a contemporary experimental novelist conceives it that I have charted as 'The Topography of (Science) Fiction.'

AB  - Les oeuvres de Wells et de Stapledon trouvent un point d'intersection dans leur conception des 'Martiens'. La rencontre des humains et des Martiens chez Stapledon, Last and First Men (LFM, 1930) trouve sa source dans le récit originel de l'invasion chez Wells, The War of the Worlds (WW, 1898), et est à relier au récit ultérieur de Wells, Star Begotten (SB, 1937). Stapledon modifie la hiérarchie des pouvoirs conçue par Wells, celle des Martiens sur les hommes sur les microbes, en faisant de ses Martiens des microbes envahisseurs. Cette modification nous éloigne des hostilités interplanétaires de WW vers une union de l'homme et des Martiens dans LFM et SB. Dans LFM, une telle union est évidemment dialectique. La confrontation, du second Homme et des Martiens peut se voir comme la réalisation des deux triades fondamentales de Stapledon: le Saint, le Sceptique et le Révolutionnaire, et le zèle moral, le désenchantement et l'extase: Le Second Homme, Saint désenchanté, doit à la fois surmonter ses propres tendances et le zèle révolutionnaire des Martiens pour survivre. Le dernier roman martien de Wells, SB, est plus coulant et moins schématique que LFM. Dans SB, les humains ne cessent de parler de la possibilité pour notre espèce d'être améliorée par 'une sorte de tuteur interplanétaire' (au cours des discussions, Wells mentionne expressément Stapledon et LFM). Les deux auteurs se sont servis des Martiens comme moyens d'expression du dilemme relatif à la connaissance d'autrui. Dans WW nous ne savons presque rien des envahisseurs, sinon à travers leurs actes; dans LFM, nous savons à peu près tout ce qu'il y a lieu d'en savoir. Le dilemme dans LFM porte alors sur la façon dont humain et Martien parviendront à se connaître. La position du lecteur dans WW et LFM reflète cette différence. Cependant dans les deux romans, la recherche de connaissances sur autrui finit par apporter une connaissance inattendue de soi-même. Dans SB enfin, la seule connaissance recherchée est aussi la seule véritable qui soit donnée: la connaissance de soi vient d'abord. Ici les Martiens ne sont qu'une idée-et un idéal. /// The careers of Wells and Stapledon intersect most clearly in their Martians. Stapledon's portrayal of the human-Martian confrontation in Last and First Men (LFM, 1930) can be traced back to Wells's seminal invasion tale, The War of the Worlds (WW, 1898), and forward to Wells's own Star-Begotten (SB, 1937). Specifically, in LFM Stapledon disrupts the Wellsian power hierarchy (of Martian over man over microbe) by turning his Martians into invading microbes. The disruption leads away from the estranged hostilities of WW toward a union of man and Martian in LFM and SB. In LFM that union is obviously dialectical. In fact, the confrontation between the Second Men and the Martians should be seen as a realization in fiction of Stapledon's two basic dialectical triads-the Saint, the Skeptic, and the Revolutionary, and moral zeal, disillusion, and ecstasy: the saintly, disillusioned Second Men must overcome themselves and the zealous revolutionaries, the Martians, in order to survive. Typically, Wells's last Martian novel, SB, is more discursive and less diagrammatic than LFM. In SB, human characters talk and talk about the possibility of our species being improved by a 'sort of inter-planetary tutor.' (And in the course of these discussions Wells even mentions Olaf Stapledon and LFM by name.) Both writers use their Martians as foils in the epistemological dilemma of knowing the Other. In WW, we know very little about the aliens, and that only through their actions. Conversely, in LFM we know almost everything there is to know about the invaders. The dilemma in LFM, then, is figuring out how the Second Men and the Martians will come to know each other. Our positions as readers-informed in LFM, confused in WW-sharply distinguish the experiences of the two texts. Nonetheless, in both tales, seeking knowledge of the Other brings unexpected knowledge of the Self. In SB, however, the only real knowledge sought is also the only real knowledge given: self-knowlege comes first. There the Martians are only an idea-and an ideal.

AB  - L'utopie a connu des résurgences périodiques dans la SF, le plus récemment en relation avec les mouvements de contestation des années soixante (et début des années soixante-dix). Certaines fictions utopiques de ces années, comme l'Ecotopia de Callenbach (1977), suivent le modèle classique, se concentrant sur un locus utopique qui est lui-même identifié à l'horizon utopique comme tel; de tels récits dépeignent de façon souvent imparfaite un 'bon lieu' comme état des choses. D'autres utopistes ont cherché à expérimenter une possibilité révolutionnaire. Dans Les Dépossédés de Le Guin (1974), l'utopie n'est pas une entité statique présentée au lecteur dans le but d'obtenir de lui son assentiment, mais elle est impliquée comme 'paradigme absent' que le lecteur est invité à reconstruire afin qu'il participe au processus du devenir, c'est-à-dire à l'essence utopique, au principe d'Espérance (Bloch) de la fiction. Samuel Delany impose la même exigence à ses lecteurs dans Triton (1976), qui cependant se place à tous égards en opposition dialectique à la pensée de Le Guin, dans la mesure où le pluralisme de sa conception 'hétérotopique' soulève des questions radicales quant à la faisabilité théorique même d'un simple horizon utopique comme celui d'Anarres, ainsi que Shevek en vient à le concevoir. Le degré d'accomplissement des oeuvres de Delany et LeGuin se mesure bien si nous les approchons en venant d'Ecotopia, du Female Man de Joanna Russ (1975) et de Woman on the Edge of Time (1976)-fictions qui dans cet ordre d'idées montrent la transition entre l'utopie doctrinaire ou dogmatique et l'utopie ouverte, laquelle culmine avec Triton et avec les Dépossédés. /// Within the SF genre, utopianism has enjoyed periodic resurgences, the most recent of which resulted from the protest movements of the 1960s and early '70s. Some of the works of utopian fiction from those years-Ernest Callenbach's Ecotopia (1977), for example-follow the model of the classical utopia in concentrating on a utopian locus and identifying it with the utopian horizon: they simply-and often imperfectly-depict the 'good place' as a state of being. Other utopists, however, have experimented with a revolutionary possibility. In The Dispossessed (1974), for instance, utopia does not exist as a static entity that the reader is told about or shown around with a view to obtaining his or her assent, but instead is implied as an 'absent paradigm' which the reader is called upon to reconstruct so as to participate in the process of becoming that is the utopian, or (in Ernst Bloch's sense) the hopeful, essence of the fiction. Samuel Delany makes similar demands upon his readers in Triton (1976), which, however, stands in dialectical opposition to Ursula Le Guin's masterpiece insofar as the pluralism of his concept of heterotopia raises radical questions about the theoretical feasibility even of the kind of single utopian horizon that Anarres, as Shevek comes to see it, points towards. Delany's and Le Guin's achievements can best be appreciated if we approach them coming from Ecotopia, Joanna Russ's The Female Man (1975), and Marge Piercy's Woman on the Edge of Time (1976)-fictions which, in that order, will serve to illustrate the transition from the doctrinaire, or dogmatic, utopian text to the open-ended one that culminates in Triton and The Dispossessed.

AB  - Le livre bien connu de L. Ron Hubbard, La dianétique: la science moderne de la santé mentale (1950), traite d'une forme populaire et peu orthodoxe de thérapie psychologique qui prétend résoudre les problèmes personnels et conduire à une existence protégée et réussie au plan social. Hubbard est le fondateur de l'Eglise de scientologie, un des cultes les plus en vue de la culture populaire américaine des années 70 et il sut en devenir le porte-parole célèbre, reconnu bien que mystérieux. A ses débuts, Hubbard écrivait de la science-fiction à bon marché pour Astounding Science Fiction de John Campbell et la dianétique puise certaines racines dans l'intérêt traditionnel que ce genre romanesque porte à la psychologie en tant que base d'une technique efficace parodiant ainsi l'idée que la science-fiction se fait du rôle des sciences physiques. Particulièrement pendant les années 50, on put s'apercevoir de l'importance de ces racines quand de nombreux écrivains, dont Campbell, furent attirés par les idées de Hubbard. Depuis les années 20, une 'science de l'esprit' était une notion de base de la science-fiction; E.E. ('Doc') Smith avait conçu des astronefs et des armes actionnés par la pensée et avant l'avènement du nucléaire, Campbell exposa ses idées sur le sujet dans plusieurs récits et dans de nombreux articles de fond. D'après Campbell, les 'science mentales' pouvaient s'étendre de la médecine psychosomatique à la télépathie, agissant en partie comme antidote aux problèmes suscités par la technologie. Mais, d'une manière significative, ces sciences correspondaient à des systèmes avancés de connaissance pouvant être appréhendés uniquement sous forme de magie. Il est également révélateur que Campbell ait considéré les anciens prêtres et devins comme des praticiens de 'la science de la magie'; de plus, il a décrit la science moderne comme de 'la magie qui fonctionne'. Au début des années 40, des écrivains comme Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov et A.E. van Vogt collaboraient à la revue de Campbell. Certaines techniques psychologiques utilisées devinrent parties intégrantes des théories de l'histoire que ces auteurs incorporaient à leurs récits. En général, ils pensaient que ces techniques éclipseraient l'économie, la politique et les autres forces considérées comme les causes déterminantes des relations sociales caractérisant les civilisations. De tels concepts leur parurent plus importants après l'avènement du nucléaire. Avant la création de la dianétique, la fiction de Hubbard peut se lire comme une critique foncièrement détachée de la société industrielle et de la faillite de la vie politique qui l'accompagne; c'est également un exposé du réjet de cette société et de cette vie politique effectué par une certaine élite. Au même moment, et en dehors de la science-fiction, de telles idées circulaient dans d'autres secteurs de la culture américaine. La psychothérapie avait recours à la psychochirurgie et aux drogues et les visées bureaucratiques, techniques et gestionnaires supplantaient les idéaux sociaux et politiques. En insistant sur le pouvoir individuel et personnel assisté de la thérapeutique et sur l'élimination de l'irrationnel et du mal, la dianétique s'insère naturellement dans ce contexte historique. De plus, Hubbard soutenait que, grâce à la dianétique, l'espace pouvait devenir un nouveau champ de déploiement de la mythologie américaine; du moins pour ceux et celles qui terminaient leur cours de thérapie et qui se débarrassaient ainsi de toutes leurs névroses. Dans l'intervalle, d'autres écrivains dont Cyril Kornbluth et Robert Bloch s'aperçurent des limites d'une telle vision du monde appliquée à la fois à la critique politique et sociale de la science-fiction ainsi qu'à la pensée et à l'action sociales. De tels concepts pouvaient justifier l'apathie et ainsi perpétuer la tyrannie. /// L. Ron Hubbard's widely advertised book, Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health (1950), describes a popular form of unorthodox psychological 'therapy' that purports to offer solutions to personal problems and to point the way to a secure and socially successful life. The Church of Scientology that he founded became one of the more prominent 'cults' characterizing American popular culture during the 1970s, and he himself became a famous, if notorious and mysterious, figure as its leader. Yet Hubbard started out as a pulp SF writer in John Campbell's Astounding Science Fiction, and Dianetics has substantial roots in SF's traditional interest in the use of psychological science as the basis for a powerful technology mimicking the genre's ideas on the role of the physical sciences. The extent of these roots was seen in the 1950s when many SF writers-Campbell among them-were initially attracted to Hubbard's ideas. A 'science of the mind' had been a staple in SF at least since the 1920s, when E.E. ('Doc') Smith had written of thought-powered spaceships and weapons, and Campbell himself had included his ideas on the subject in some of his fictions and many of his editorials even before the achievement of nuclear power. From Campbell's perspective, 'mental sciences' might mean anything from psychosomatic medicine to telepathy, partially as an antidote for the problems created by the use of physical technology, but more significantly as advanced systems of knowledge not yet fully understood, except as various forms of magic. Equally significantly, Campbell wrote of his respect for ancient priests and soothsayers as practitioners of 'the Science of Magic,' and he would later describe modern science as 'The Magic that Works.' During the early 1940s, writers publishing in Campbell's magazine (e.g., Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, and A.E. van Vogt) made a variety of psychological technologies integral parts of the theories of history incorporated in their stories. In general, all of them imagined that these technologies would eventually displace economics, politics, and other forces as the principal determinants of social relationships in human civilizations. Such concepts seemed more important to them after the achievement of nuclear power. The fiction Hubbard wrote before he created Dianetics can be read as a severely alienated critique of modern industrial society and the failure of the political life associated with it, as well as a brief for the abandonment of both by an elite. Such concepts appeared outside the orbit of SF in American culture at the same time-viz., during the years in which psychosurgery and the use of drugs were becoming increasingly characteristic of orthodox psychotherapy and in which bureaucratic, technical, and managerial objectives were increasingly being substituted for social and political ideals. Dianetics' emphasis on individual, personal empowerment through therapy and on the elimination of irrationality and evil thus fit very nicely into that historical context. Moreover, Hubbard explicitly stated that Dianetics would permit the extension of the frontier of American mythology into outer space, at least for those who completed the course of therapy and were 'cleared' of all their neuroses. Meanwhile, however, SF writers such as Cyril Kornbluth and Robert Bloch were able to see the limitations that such a world-view placed both upon political and social criticism in SF and upon political and social thought and action in civic life. They were able to recognize how ideas such as Hubbard's could in fact become justifications for an apathetic resignation to the continuation of tyranny.

AB  - Robert Barr (1850-1912) était écrivain et éditeur et il a vécu à la fin de l'ère victorienne. Il est surtout célèbre pour avoir terminé le The O'Ruddy de Stephen Crane et pour avoir inventé le personnage du détective français, Eugène Valmont. Il est également l'auteur de deux romans et de plusieurs nouvelles qui utilisent des éléments de science-fiction. Il emprunta aux technologies de pointe de son temps; par exemple, il traita d'explosifs, d'extraction d'azote et de rayons X et il s'en servit dans ses fictions mélodramatiques à vocation récréative plutôt que didactique. Cependant, on constate que ses écrits sont traversés par un courant satirique et une aversion toute victorienne pour les nouvelles réalités technologiques, c'est-à-dire une sorte de 'critique civique' qui ne se trouve que rarement dans la science-fiction du début du siècle. De plus, les sujets dont il se préoccupe, soit la pollution atmosphérique ('The Doom of London'), l'énergie atomique (A Rock in the Baltic) et le terrorisme ('A New Explosive'), sont plutôt d'actualité. /// Robert Barr (1850-1912) was a late Victorian writer and editor now remembered chiefly for completing Stephen Crane's The O'Ruddy and for creating the French detective Eugene Valmont. But he also produced two novels and a number of short stories with S-F elements in them. He used developing technologies-explosives, nitrogen extraction, Röntgen rays-as essential ingredients in his melodramatic fictions, which were designed to entertain rather than to instruct. There is in them, however, an undertone of satire as well as a Victorian distaste for the new technological facts of life-a form of 'civic criticism' somewhat unusual for SF at the turn of the century. Besides, the topics of his stories-e.g., deadly air pollution (in 'The Doom of London'), atomic energy (in A Rock in the Baltic), and terrorism (in 'A New Explosive')-make them seem rather timely these days.

AB  - Calvino ne se considère pas comme écrivain de science-fiction, et ce pour différentes raisons qui ont trait à la fois à la situation du genre en Italie à l'époque où 'Cosmicomics' et 'Temps zéro' ont été publiés ainsi qu'a certains préjugés concernant la définition du genre, par exemple celui qui assimile la science-fiction au roman d'anticipation scientifique. Confrontés à la typologie du genre telle que l'a établie Darko Suvin, ces deux ouvrages, par leur démarche cognitive, pluritemporelle et distanciée, s'avèrent toutefois appartenir à la grande littérature de science-fiction. Chez Calvino, cette démarche aboutit à l'édification d'une utopie cognitive, fruit des exigences d'ordre, d'identité et de pragmatisme qui correspondent aux thèmes repris tout au long des écrits étudiés. Pour l'écrivain, l'œuvre littéraire qui en résulte implique un engagement situé au niveau stylistique. Par sa mise à l'écart en rapport avec les normes de la réalité établie, ceci transmet au lecteur la notion de possibilité de transformation du monde. /// Italo Calvino did not think of himself as an SF writer. This fact, however, has to do with the situation of SF in Italy at the time 'Cosmicomics' and 'T Zero' were published more than with certain prejudices about how SF is to be defined-such as the notion that the genre should be wholly identified with the novel of scientific anticipation. Given a generic typology like that which Darko Suvin establishes, the two works of Calvino's just mentioned can properly be claimed as belonging among the best SF by reason of their mode of proceeding, which is at once cognitive, pluritemporal, and estranged. This proceeding leads Calvino to construct cognitive utopian fictions, the product of the demands for order, identity, and applicability to the extra-fictional world, all of which are thematized in his 'cosmicomical' stories. The result is an œuvre which implies, especially on the stylistic level (in both the narrow and the broadest sense), an engagement on the part of the writer. Calvino, in other words, calls into question established norms of thinking in a way that also imparts the idea of the world's transformability.

AB  - L'allusion que Huxley fait à l'homme politique français Maurice Bokanowski souligne la satire de l'organisation scientifique du travail dans Le meilleur des mondes. Comme son homologue anglais, Alfred Mond, Bokanowski était un fervent partisan de la rationnalisation scientifique du travail. Il pensait qu'elle apporterait la stabilité économique et politique. Egalement, sa préférence pour une coalition dirigeante d'hommes d'affaire et de technocrats le rapproche d'un autre sujet satirique de Huxley: le 'open conspirateur' de H.G. Wells. L'allusion à Bokanowsky fait également référence à l'anarchiste russe Ivan Bokhanovskii (1848-1917). Ainsi un seul symbole unit un héro de la droite et un de la gauche dans le panthéon du 'meilleur des mondes'. De la même façon, le roman rappelle, à la manière satirique, les buts paradoxalement identiques du Capitalisme et du Communisme. /// Huxley's allusion to French politician Maurice Bokanowski adds emphasis to the satire on the rationalization of industry in Brave New World, for like his English counterpart Sir Alfred Mond, Bokanowski was a high-profile advocate of rationalized industry as a means to achieving economic and political stability. His preference for a governing coalition of businessmen and technocrats makes him resemble another object of Huxley's satire: H.G. Wells's open conspirator. The 'Bokanovsky' allusion also suggests the Russian anarchist Ivan Bokhanovsky (1848-1917), thereby uniting in one symbol torch bearers of the political right and the left in the pantheon of the Brave New World, just as the novel often satirically points to the paradoxical sameness of Communist and Capitalist ends.

AB  - La science-fiction évoque souvent un sentiment d'émerveillement bien connu mais parfois, certains écrits exposent des éléments narratifs qui seraient taxés de fantastique dans des contextes différents. Dans cet essai, j'examine l'acclimatation du personnage du vampire lors de son introduction dans les récits de science-fiction. Je me penche sur deux écrits, The Space Vampires (1976) de Colin Wilson et I, Vampire (1984) de Jody Scott. A sa façon, chacun des textes est une réécriture et jusqu'à un certain point, une parodie de Dracula de Bram Stoker. Cependant, il est intéressant de remarquer que The Space Vampires, en se conformant aux conventions génériques de la science-fiction, consolide une idéologie conservatrice du texte. Dans I, Vampire, le reject amusé des limites entre la science-fiction et la fantaisie est issu d'une idéologie plus radical et produit des résultats plus marqués. Il me semble que la façon dont Wilson présent le vampire comme étranger/autre suit de près le personnage de Stoker. Par contre, à travers le remaniement féministe qu'opère Scott, on assiste à une subversion du genre et également à un effritement de l'opposition conventionnelle entre l'humain et l'étranger. Ce renouveau pour la fiction traitant du vampire est surtout l'oeuvre d'auteures; cela donne lieu à des représentations éloquentes du vampire vu comme 'l'autre' dont la portée critique vise les processus de marginalisation résultant des représentations patriarchales. /// While SF often evokes in its readers a proverbial 'sense of wonder,' it also works to 'domesticate' narrative elements which, in different generic contexts, would be considered fantastic. In this essay, I examine the domestication of the figure of the vampire through its introduction into SF narratives. I analyze two texts in particular: Colin Wilson's The Space Vampires (1976) and Jody Scott's I, Vampire (1984). Each, in its own way, is a rewriting, and thus, to some extent, a parody, of Bram Stoker's Dracula. However, it is interesting to note the degree to which the compliance of The Space Vampires with the genre conventions of SF serves to consolidate a conservative textual ideology, while the more playful rejection of the boundaries between SF and fantasy in I, Vampire both derives from and results in a more radical ideological coloration. It seems to me that Wilson's treatment of the vampire as alien/Other closely parallels Stoker's original treatment in Dracula, while Scott's feminist revision not only undertakes a generic subversion, but also undermines the conventional human/alien opposition. The recent resurgence of vampire fiction, much of it by women writers, has produced some intriguing re-presentations of the vampire as Outsider which function as critiques of the marginalizations effected by patriarchal representations.

AB  - Du point de vue humain, le réel tel qu'il est n'existe pas. Il y a toujours un modèle idéologique qui intervient et qui oriente la perception que nous en avons. La véracité de cette affirmation s'impose dès que nous nous penchons sur la science-fiction soviétique. Ce n'est pas seulement parce que nous, en tant qu'Occidentaux, sommes sensibles au contenu idéologique plus ou moins étranger des oeuvres, mais parce que les auteurs de la science-fiction soviétique sont, en général, plus conscients de l'idéologie que leurs collègues de l'Occident. Jusqu'aux environs des années 70 et au début des années 80, nous pouvons décéler trois époques ou périodes qui caractérisent la science-fiction soviétique. La première période se déploie aux alentours de la Révolution bolchévique et elle reflète l'implication des auteurs et des lecteurs face à cet événement. Ces écrits ilustrent une 'merveilleuse catastrophe', c'est-à-dire les forces du chaos provoquent la chute de l'ordre ancien et permettent la naissance d'une nouvelle organisation. C'est toute l'humanité qui est au coeur de la science-fiction de cette période plutôt que l'individu et le conflit se déroule entre des pouvoirs hostiles et irréconciliables: les tenants de l'ordre ancien contre ceux qui prônent l'ordre nouveau. Généralement, l'espace temporel, qui correspond à la sensation d'urgence de la Révolution, est plus étroit et plus uniforme que les dimensions spatiales qui tendent de s'accorder avec celles de l'univers. Au sein du 'chronotype de la catastrophe', il fait preuve d'une pluralité idéologique qui reflète essentiellement l'hétérogénéité du National-bolchévisme et de plus affiche un élan très marqué vers l'utopie qui se révèle par l'ebauche-et parfois le portrait-d'un ordre nouveau (bien que quelquefois on peut y décéler des touches anti-utopiques comme chez Zamyatine, par exemple). La montée de Staline mit brusquement un terme à cette première epoque. Vers la fin des années 20 et au début des années 30, la science-fiction qui la remplace était plutôt codifiée, incontestablement paranoïaque et figée dogmatiquement. Au cours de cette seconde phase, la science-fiction soviétique gravite autour d'une polarisation de forces antagonistes. Cependant, la confrontation se fait maintenant entre les guardiens de l'Etat soviétique et de son idéologie officielle et les méchants conspirateurs ou espions dont le but est le renversement infâme de cet ordre. On assiste à un repli de l'utopie; l'espace de la fiction est local plutôt que cosmique et le temps narratif se contracte jusqu'aux limites, disons, d'un plan quinquennal. En contraste avec la science-fiction de la période révolutionnaire, les perspectives utopiques sont plus ou moins de nature scientifique et technologique (par example, les accessoires nouveaux) au lieu de tendre vers la transformation de la société. A la fin des années 40 et au début des années 50, cette science-fiction, à formule idéologique sévère, est devenue une parodie accidentelle d'elle-même aussi bien que de la doctrine idéologique officielle qu'elle devait soutenir. Ainsi, nous voyons apparaître, vers la fin des années 50, une science-fiction dont l'ideologie et plus ouverte que celle de ces prédécesseurs. Cette ouverture ne dure pas longtemps car certaines limites y sont appliquées dans les années 60, limites qui toutefois n'étaient pas aussi rigoureuses que celles de l'ère stalinienne. La science-fiction de la troisième époque résume quelque peu les deux premières mais elle s'en éloigne par la façon de traiter l'idéologie dans le façonnement du réel. Pris individuellement, les écrits de science-fiction de cette phase ne sont pas inspirés ni dominés par une seule idéologie mais ils illustrent le choc des idéologies. Ainsi ils font renaître les tendances utopiques de la science-fiction des débuts en termes plus assurés et à travers une forme traduisant des alternatives idéologiques plutôt que sociales. Le point culminant de cette troisième époque est ponctué par les oeuvres d'Efremov et des Strougatski. Les héros des écrits des Strougatski sont des individus mais habituellement, ils sont vus comme des individus-types mais c'est l'humanité dans son ensemble qui est mise en lumière par Efremov. De même leurs préférences idéologiques diffèrent. Néanmoins, les oeuvres ont en commun un souci humaniste qui découle de la même préoccupation soit d'offrir des visions utopiques alternatives. L'une de ces visions dérive du 'mythe officiel' tandis que l'autre est une édification idéologique qui s'oppose à l'idéologie admise et qui la remet en question. /// There is no such thing, from a human point of view at least, as reality as it is. Some ideological model or other always mediates and informs our perception of it. The truth of this proposition is especially evident in regard to Soviet SF; and this is so not just because we in the West are aware of its ideological content for its being more or less alien to us but also because Soviet SF authors generally have a greater consciousness of ideology than do their Western counterparts. Soviet SF through the 1970s and early '80s can be parcelled out into three stages or periods. The first of these centers around the time of the Russian Revolution and reflects the involvement with that Revolution on the part of both writers of SF and their readers. Typically this SF features a 'wonderful catastrophe': the forces of chaos produce the collapse of the old world order, out of which comes new organization. Soviet SF in this phase focusses on humanity rather than on the individual and concerns a conflict between irreconcilably hostile powers (representing the old order versus the bearers of the new). Generally speaking at least, its temporal scope (corresponding to the Revolution's sense of urgency) is narrower and more homogeneous than its spatial dimensions, which tend to coincide with those of the universe. Within the 'catastrophe chronotope,' it exhibits a certain ideological diversity, but one which basically reflects the varieties of National-Bolshevism and by the same token displays a pronounced utopian impulse (in the adumbrating, if not the clear depiction, of a new world order-though the utopian horizon may also include anti-utopian prospects, as in the case of Zamiatin). This first phase ended rather abruptly with the rise of Stalin. By the late 1920s or early '30s, it had already been totally displaced by an SF which was markedly formulaic, decidedly paranoid, and ideologically ossified. Soviet SF in this second phase continues to revolve around a polarization of antagonistic forces, but now the conflict is between the upholders of the Soviet State and its official ideology and villainous conspirators and spies bent on the nefarious overthrow of that order. The utopian horizon accordingly closes in considerably: the fictive space becomes local rather than cosmic and fictive time increasingly contracts to the length, say, of a Five-Year Plan. So, too-and in contrast to the SF of the Revolutionary period-what utopian prospects this SF holds out are more or less narrowly scientific-technological (i.e., involving new gadgetry) rather than pointing towards societal transformation. By the late '40s and early '50s, such SF adhering to a strict ideological formula had turned into an unwitting parody not only of itself but of the official ideology whose tenets it was expected to uphold. It thereupon gave way, in the late '50s, to an SF that was more ideologically open than its predecessors had been. This openness, however, did not last much beyond the '60s, after which certain limitations were put on it (though these were not so severe as those of the Stalinist period). While in that regard Soviet SF of the third phase recapitulates to some extent that of the first two, it differs from them in the way that ideology figures in its modelling of reality. Looked upon individually, the SF works of this period are not informed and dominated by a single ideology but instead turn on the clash of ideologies. They thereby resuscitate the utopianism of early Soviet SF, but in qualified terms and in the form of what are, first of all, ideological possibilities rather than social ones. Soviet SF in this third phase reaches its high point in Efremov and the Strugatskys. The Strugatskys' heroes are individuals (but usually type-cast individuals), whereas Efremov concentrates on humanity at large, and likewise their respective ideological preferences differ from one another. Nevertheless, their works share a humanistic tendency which comes out of their common concern with offering alternative (utopian) visions: one emanating from 'official myth,' the other an ideological construct opposing it and hence calling official ideology into question.

Although for many years unaware of the Complex's symmetrical structure (rooted in 'Welcome to Mars') until an English correspondent. Paul Shackley, pointed it out to him in the early 1970s, Blish expanded 'Beep' (1954) into The Quincunx of Time (1973) with that structure very much in mind.

C'est, semble-t-il, la fonction de l'oeuvre fictionnelle de Paul M.A. Linebarger, alliée au travail d'une psychothérapie.

Paul M.A. Linebarger's fiction appears to have served the latter kind of function for him, assisted by psychotherapeutic treatment. Evidence for Linebarger's psychological development is examined in his life history, in his mainstream novels, and in several of the most important SF works he wrote under the pseudonym of Cordwainer Smith: 'Scanners Live in Vain,' 'The Game of Rat and Dragon,' and Norstrilia.

C'est de moins ce que laisse entendre certains parallèles entre 'Last and First Men' et Paradise Lost de Milton. Plusieurs points rapprochent les deux écrivains. D'abord, Stapledon, à la suite de Milton, utilise une muse (l'un des 'Last Men') afin de transmettre une autorité incontestable à la vision inspirée de la narration. Ensuite, Stapledon est lui aussi parvenu à écrire dans une perspective cosmique, à l'aide de métaphores musicales et de métaphores relatives à 'l'envolée'. Il y est parvenue également en mettant l'accent sur l'éducation et l'éveil du lecteur, ainsi qu'en adaptant du matériel biblique. Alors que Virgile et Homère ont accordé une place prépondérante à la guerre, Stapledon et Milton ont préféré évoquer des idéaux plus nobles chez l'homme, à savoir sa lutte pour la réalisation de son immense potentiel. /// Certain parallels between Olaf Stapledon's 'Last and First Men' and Milton's Paradise Lost suggest that Stapledon intended his novel to be read in the tradition of the Miltonic epic. Like Milton, Stapledon employs a muse (one of the Last Men) to lend irrefutable authority to the inspired vision of the narrative. Stapledon also resembles Milton in his achievement of a cosmic perspective, in his use of the metaphors of flight and music, in his emphasis on the education or awakening of the reader, and in his adaptation of biblical materials. Avoiding the emphasis on war found in the Homeric and Virgilian epic, Milton and Stalpedon both discover a higher subject in the struggle of the human spirit toward the fulfillment of its great potential.

AB  - À quelques exceptions près, les premières représentations de la guerre nucléaire en science-fiction ne tenaient pas compte justement de la science et étaient peu développées du point de vue littéraire. La science-fiction de l'époque faisait preuve d'un optimisme délirant, réduisait l'importance des conséquences probables d'une guerre nucléaire, ou en exagérait la portée, produisant ainsi les traditionnels effets d'apocalypse. Les écrivains de science-fiction des années quarante et cinquante s'enorgueillissaient de leur orientation scientifique et de leurs prédictions d'une guerre atomique. Mais la meilleure production d'oeuvres sur ce sujet provenait surtout des quelques écrivains représentatifs du genre. La situation s'améliora d'une part avec l'évolution des techniques d'écriture et, d'autre part, à la suite du succès sans précédent remporté par plusieurs livres et films de la fin des années cinquante et du début des années soixante. /// With few exceptions, early SF depictions of nuclear war were neither scientifically accurate nor literarily sophisticated. Expressing wild optimism, minimizing the probable consequences of a nuclear war, or exaggerating them to produce traditional apocalyptic effects were all common. Despite the fact that SF prided itself on its scientific orientation and its prediction of atomic warfare, it was principally mainstream writers who produced the best fiction on the subject during the 1940s and '50s. The success of several books and movies during the late '50s and early '60s, combined with the growing sophistication of literary technique within SF, changed this situation markedly.

AB  - Quelle est la nature de la science dans la science-fiction? Quel rôle joue-t-elle? Est-ce un thème ou un sujet? Fonctionne-t-elle véritablement comme un procédé de recherche? Si tel est le cas, en montrant le démarche par laquelle l'être humain enquête sur le monde, la science pourrait offrir à la fiction de nouvelles dimensions et de nouvelles formes. Ainsi, pour S. Lem, une telle fiction devrait accentuer la 'structure descriptive' du texte (procédé par lequel on décrit et en décrivant, on comprend le monde extérieur) plutôt que la structure des actions. Mais Lem doute que la fiction soit efficace à remplir cette tâche puisque les structures narratives sont traditionnellement limitées au point du vue humain. Cet essai examine la question posée par Lem: la science-fiction, peut-elle fonctionner comme une 'fiction épistémologique'? Pour ce faire, nous proposons de substituer à l'expression de Lem, 'structures descriptives' la locution qui va au coeur du problème: 'structures de l'appréhension'. Le mot signifie perception ou entendement ainsi que appréhension et crainte. Le terme 'appréhension' associe la connaissance à la terreur pascalienne ressentie par l'être humain face à la nature qui l'engloutit. De plus, le mot fournit le lien qui relie la science à la fiction dans la formule 'science-fiction' et enfin, il offre un moyen de mesurer la tension entre ces extrémités. Confronté à la science en tant qu'epistémologie, Lem constate que la fiction est limitée par les structures humaines inhérentes au genre. Mais en cultivant ces structures de l'appréhension, la science fiction est le moyen narratif qui peut donner une forme à l'absence de forme ou au vide, c'est-à-dire à la séparation qui s'élargit depuis Descartes entre la raison et le monde des res extensa. La lecture de trois textes clés, Solaris de Lem, Time Enough for Love de Heinlein et Pique-nique au bord de la route des frères Strougatski, nous permettra d'examiner trois 'structures de l'appréhension' dans la science-fiction actuelle. Le roman de Lem présente ce que nous appelons la structure sceptique et celui de Heinlein, la structure sentimentale. Le récit des Strougatski illustre une troisième structure plus complexe, celle de la complémentarité. Dans leur réponse à la dualité de la raison et de la nature, les deux premières structures sont peut-être dignes du 18è siècle qui voulait que l'entendement humain soit considéré comme un système cohérent et invariable. En accord avec les hypothèses récentes de la science, la troisième structure montre la science-fiction en train d'explorer les rapports de participation entre raison et nature et donc convertir la dualité cartésienne en une complémentarité à la manière de Bohr. /// What is the nature of science in SF, and what role does it play in shaping its fictions? Is it a 'theme'? Or a 'subject'? Or does it, as is often claimed, operate as a method of inquiry, causing fictional structures to shape themselves around the cognitive adventure of humankind as it investigates the material universe? Such fiction, for Stanislaw Lem, would have to focus, not on actions or characters, but on the 'structure of the description.' But Lem doubts that fiction, because its structures are traditionally limited to a human viewpoint, is (inherently) adequate to this task. Epistemological or 'cognitive' fiction for Lem is a logical contradiction in terms. And yet Lem himself is drawn to attempt such fiction. And to do so within the traditional frame, not just of fiction, but of SF. This essay examines the limitations and possibilities of SF as epistemological fiction. In order to do so, however, it modulates the problem by renaming Lem's structures of description structures of apprehension. To apprehend is not simply to know, but to touch and to fear as well. The term is more apt than Lem's because it takes into consideration the fact that human science-precisely because, as Lem says, humankind's theories are fictions, and hence mirror-images of the human mind and the mark of its inherent limitation-is both a logical and an apprehensive process, where the fear is the loss of a human identity itself. Apprehension is the tension on the thread that links science and fiction in the SF compound. And SF, under the sign of this apprehension, is the fictional form that most clearly addresses the increasing epistemological separation, first formulated by Descartes and Pascal, between human reason and extended nature-inner and outer space. This essay examines three existent structures of apprehension in SF: the skeptical, as exemplified by Lem's Solaris (1971); the sentimental, as in Heinlein's Time Enough for Love (1973); and in the Strugatskys' Roadside Picnic (1972), the complementary. The first two remain essentially 18th-century responses to the mind-nature duality-responses whose apprehensive nature derives from the fact that the human mind in the first case, or the human form in the second, strives to preserve, in its cognitive dealings with the extended world, its identity as coherent and invariable system. In the Strugatskys, however, we have signs of SF seeking-in line with recent speculation in science on the human mind as a system in constant participation with the phenomenal world-to convert Cartesian duality into a relationship of complementarity in the Bohrian sense of the word.

AB  - Pamela Sargent a écrit cinq romans pour jeunes adultes dans lesquels on retrouve la même sagacité et les mêmes préoccupations que dans ses autres écrits. Ces derniers empruntent à une vaste gamme de technologies contemporaines dont la cybernétique, l'ingénierie biologique, le voyage intersidéral et la science atomique. Quel que soit le cadre du récit, Sargent se concentre toujours sur des personnages représentés méticuleusement et condamnés à vivre avec les conséquences de la révolution technologique ou bien, dans certains cas, avec sa dégénérescence. Les cinq romans écrits poour jeunes adultes: Watchstar (1980), The Eye of the Comet (1984), Homesmind (1984), Earthseed (1983), et Alien Child (1988) sont, au plan stylistique, moins élaborés que ses autres livres, mais à l'encontre de nombreux autres récits du genre, ils exigent que les lecteurs soient armés de curiosité et prêts à affronter des idées et des situations non-conformistes. Dans ces écrits, le changement technologique et l'évolution humaine sont inextricablement liés et l'humanité doit se mesurer aux conséquences de la science moderne plutôt que de les fuir. Sargent loue la jeunesse ainsi que le potentiel de changement rendu possible par la technologie. Ainsi, ses romans pour jeunes adultes ont une facture mobile et romanesque et peuvent se comparer à la meilleure science-fiction pours aînés. /// Pamela Sargent's five SF novels for young adults display the same insight and concerns that characterize her novels for adult readers. The latter extrapolate from a broad range of contemporary technologies, including cybernetics, biological engineering, space travel, and atomic science. Regardless of the setting, however, her principal focus is always the carefully drawn characters who must live with the consequences of the technological revolution-or, in some cases, devolution. Her five SF novels for younger readers-Watchstar (1980), The Eye of the Comet (1984), Homesmind (1984), Earth-seed (1983), and Alien Child (1988)-are simpler stylistically than her other books; but unlike many novels of the genre, they assume an audience with a speculative intelligence and an eagerness to be confronted with unconventional ideas and situations. In them, technological change and human evolution are inextricably entwined; humanity must come to terms with, rather than escape, the consequences of modern science. Sargent celebrates youth and the positive potential for change made possible by technology. Her novels for young adults are, therefore, as freewheeling and imaginative as the best SF for adults is.

Plusieurs éléments doivent être soulignés: les séries d'événements rituels, le symbolisme du miroir ovale du couloir et le statut générique tout particulier de ce roman qui pourrait être qualifié de 'dystopie contextuelle'. Cette forme se démarque de la dystopie conventionelle par l'intérêt porté aux faits historiques discontinus qui suivirent la dystopie (il est à noter que cet intérêt n'est pas prévu par le discours dystopien) et par les conséquences découlant de l'interprétation judicieusement équilibrée qui furent suscitées par l'intérêt initial. Mary McCarthy n'a pas su reconnaître cette distinction générique et ce manque est en partie responsable de sa critique négative. /// Of particular interest in Margaret Atwood's 'The Handmaid's Tale' (1985)-to date the best English Canadian SF novel-are the series of ritual events, the symbolism of the oval hallway mirror, and its generic status as a particular kind of what is termed a 'Contextual Dystopia.' This kind is distinguished from the traditional dystopia by virtue of both its consideration of the discontinuous historical circumstances (unanticipated within the dystopian discourse) which succeeded the dystopian regime, and of the judiciously balanced interpretative consequences of that consideration. Mary McCarthy's negative review of 'The Handmaid's Tale' is countered partly in terms of her failure to recognize this generic distinction.

AB  - En Hongrie, durant les quinze dernières années, on assiste à la mise en place d'une infrastructure valable bien qu'encore rudimentaire de production de science-fiction. Il s'agit d'une sous-culture organisée qui s'articule autour d'écrivains, de lecteurs, d'éditeurs de revues, de divers moyens de communication et de relations internationales. Cette sous-culture peut s'appuyer sur une tradition littéraire indigène et minoritaire, le fantastique. Ce genre comprend des écrivains qui sont parmi les plus importants écrivains hongrois du 20e siècle: Mihály Babits, Frigyes Karinthy et Tibor Déri. De plus, Gyula Hernádi, Péter Lengyel, Péter Zsoldos et Dezsö Tandori, ainsi que de jeunes écrivains prometteurs qui oeuvrent dans leur giron, illustrent le genre par des écrits dignes d'une littérature de calibre international. En même temps et d'une façon problématique, cet aspect créatif de la science-fiction est en général peu connu des institutions en place qui s'occupent d'histoire et de critique littéraire, d'éducation et de transmission officielle de la culture; en outre, rien n'est entrepris pour le légitimer. Cette réflexion s'applique également aux expériences formelles plus sophistiquées de la science-fiction hongroise au sein même de cette sous-culture de science-fiction. /// In the past 15 years, there has developed in Hungary the basic skeleton of a serious infrastructure for SF production in terms of an organized subculture of writers, readers, publishers, journals, other accessible media of communication, and international relations. This subculture can draw strength from a strong indigenous minority literary tradition of fantastic writing whose contributors include some of the most important Hungarian prose writers of the 20th century-among them, Mihály Babits, Frigyes Karinthy, and Tibor Déri. Writing at an international level of literary merit continues to be produced within the genre by the likes of Gyula Hernádi, Péter Lengyel, Péter Zsoldos, and Dezsö Tandori, and potentially also by a generation of young writers working near and around them. At the same time-and problematically-this creativity in SF remains generally unacknowledged, and certainly unlegitimated, by the main institutions of literary history, literary criticism, education, and official cultural transmission. This also applies, even within the SF subculture, to the more sophisticated formal experiments in Hungarian SF.

AB  - Darko Suvin. La science-fiction victorienne, 1871-1885: l'émergence du sous-genre de l'uchronie.-L'année 1871 marque un soudain développement de la SF au Royaume-Uni, ouvrant une période de l'histoire du genre qui s'étend, selon les points de vue qu'on adopte, jusqu'en 1901 (Wells), jusqu'à la Première guerre mondiale ou jusqu'aux années trente. Dans cette période, les principaux sous-genres de la SF sont: les Voyages extraordinaires, les Guerres futures et les Uchronies (The Coming Race de Bulwer-Lytton, 1871, préfigurant en fait ces trois types). L'uchronie qui dépasse et supplante l'utopie classique, comme 'anatomie' statique, présente un lieu fictionnel alternatif articulant des solutions différentes aux problèmes sociaux et produisant une altération de l'histoire du monde imaginé. On en trouve en 1871-79 deux variantes tendancielles: la version comicosatirique et la sérieuse. Pour les textes de 1880-85, DS les classe en 'grossiers' et 'relativement sophistiqués'. L'auteur étudie un groupe principal de 33 récits publiés entre 1871 et 1885 (bibliographie dans la note). Il analyse non seulement les caractéristiques formelles des différentes versions et thématiques de l'uchronie, mais aussi les conditions idéologiques et sociales qui leur conferent une raison d'être et une signification. La valeur critique et le degré de réussite esthétique de Flatland d'Edwin Abbott (1884-qui anticipe Zamiatine) et d'After London de Richard Jefferies (1885-qui préfigure la fiction de Wells et au-delà) sont particulièrement mis en lumière. (L'essai de DS est la prépublication d'un chapitre de son livre SF in Britain 1848-1900 à paraître chez G.K. Hall à Boston, fin 1983.) /// The year 1871 witnesses a sudden development in UK SF, opening a period in the history of the genre which extends-according to the point of view one adopts-to 1901 (with Well's The First Men in the Moon), to the First World War, or even into the 1930s. The principal sub-genres of this period in SF are the Extraordinary Voyage, the Future War Novel, and the Alternative History (Bulwer Lytton's The Coming Race prefigures all three). The Alternative History, which succeeds and supplants the Classical Utopia cum static 'anatomy,' presents an alternate fictional place displaying various solutions to current societal problems through an imagined alteration (varying in extent) of world history. Focusing on a group of 33 such Histories (as specified in note), Suvin finds that those of the years 1871-79 can be classed as either 'comico-satiric' or 'serious,' and those of 1880-85 as 'coarse' or 'relatively sophisticated.' His analysis is directed not only towards identifying the formal characteristics and thematic concerns of such Alternative Histories but also the ideological and social conditions which give them their raison d'être and their significance. The high points of the sub-genre through 1885, both from an aesthetic point of view and as social criticism, come with Edwin Abbott's Flatland (1884; which anticipates, inter alia, Zamiatin) and Richard Jefferies' After London (1885; which looks ahead to Wells and beyond).

KW  - "Hans Phaall: A Tale"
AB  - Maurice J. Bennett. Edgar Allan Poe et la tradition littéraire de spéculation sélénite.-Le récit d'Edgar Poe sur un voyage imaginaire à la Lune, 'Aventure sans pareille d'un certain Hans Pfaall,' est précurseur de toutes les oeuvres contemporaines de SF qui content des aventures astronautiques. L'exactitude scientifique et technologique que souligne la note ajoutée à l'édition de 1840, a contribué à la formulation des intérêts thématiques et narratifs du genre. Ces critères ont leur origine dans le désir de Poe de séparer son conte de ceux qui précédaient et de mettre en valeur l'originalité et la supériorité de sa propre tentative. En même temps, Poe signalait l'existence d'une tradition littéraire du voyage à la Lune et dirigeait l'attention du lecteur vers les oeuvres les plus exemplaires de cette tradition. Les prétentions d'un écrivain à l'originalité et sa critique des oeuvres qu'il regarde comme rivales sont toujours suspectes. Le présent essai examine les oeuvres que Poe reconnaissait comme précurseurs de son histoire et celles qui semblent pertinentes pour la détermination du degré d'innovation de Poe et de ses dettes envers ses prédécesseurs. Sur le visage qui apparaît dans le croissant de la lune (1er siècle Ap. J.-C.) de Plutarque; l'Histoire véritable (2ième siècle Ap. J.C.) de Lucien de Samosate; Somnium, Sive Astronomia Lunaris (1634) de Johann Kepler; The Man in the Moone (1638, 1640) de John Wilkins; L'Autre monde (1650-57) de Cyrano de Bergerac; et A Voyage to the Moon (1827) de George Tucker-toutes ces oeuvres participent aux conventions narratives et thématiques qui, bien que modifiées et camouflées, sont aussi parties intégrantes de 'Hans Pfaall'. Parmi ces conventions, on trouve l'emploi de la 'science' et de l'analogie logique pour l'exploration imaginative du cosmos interplanétaire; la Lune comme position avantageuse pour analyser la vie intellectuelle et sociale de la Terre; et la distinction, si notable dans la note de 'Hans Pfaall', entre la rationalité supérieure du texte postérieur et les imperfections de ses précurseurs. L'innovation importante de ce conte de Poe n'est point la vraisemblance ni la plausibilité dont il se vante, mais l'objet et le motif du voyage de son héros. Toutes les oeuvres qui précèdent 'Hans Pfaall' s'intéressent aux questions publiques-l'état de la science, la philosophie, les moeurs. Mais Hans Pfaall s'enfuit précisément pour échapper à ces choses qui lui sont devenues insupportables. Il découvre ainsi un projet secret, le projet romantique d'échanger les soucis quotidiens pour la liberté imaginative. Symboliquement, Pfaall dépasse les bornes de la réalité terrestre pour atteindre à une existence au-delà de l'espace et du temps. Dans son conte, Poe a combiné la science et le mysticisme que des critiques comme Samuel R. Delany regardent comme l'empreinte même de la SF. /// Edgar Allan Poe's short story about a fictive voyage to the Moon, 'The Unparallelled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall,' is the precursor of all contemporary SF works recounting astronautical adventures. The scientific and technological exactitude underscored in the note Poe added to the 1840 edition has contributed to the formulation of the thematic and narrative concerns of the genre. Such concerns derive from Poe's desire to differentiate his tale from those which preceded it and to signal the originality and superiority of his own effort. At the same time, he points to the existence of a literary tradition of lunar voyages and directs the reader's attention to the most exemplary works in that tradition. An author's pretensions to originality and his critique of writers whom he regards as rivals must always be suspect. Accordingly, I examine not only the texts which Poe acknowledges as precursors of 'Hans Pfaall' but also others which seem pertinent for determining his literary debts and his degreee of innovativeness. Plutarch's On the Face Appearing within the Orb of the Moon (1st century A.D.), Lucian's A True History (2nd century A.D.), Kepler's Somnium (1634), Francis Godwin's The Man in the Moone (1638), Wilkins's The Discovery of a World in the Moon (1638, 1640), Cyrano's L'Autre monde (1650-57), and George Tucker's A Voyage to the Moon (1827)-these all partake of narrative and thematic conventions which are also integral to 'Hans Pfaall,' albeit displaced and camoflaged in it. Among those conventions are the use of 'science' and analogical logic for the imaginative exploration of the cosmos, for analyzing the intellectual and social life of Earth from the vantage point of the Moon, and for distinguishing (as Poe's endnote makes clear) the superior rationality of 'Hans Pfaall' from the imperfections of its forebears. The important innovation in this story of Poe's lies not in the verisimilitude or the plausibility which he vaunts, but in the object and motive of his hero's voyage. All the works which came before 'Hans Pfaall' concerned themselves with public questions: with the state of science, with philosophy, with manners and mores. Pfaall, however, flees precisely to escape from these things, which to him have become insupportable. His story thus discovers a secret project: the Romantic one of exchanging quotidien cares for imaginative freedom. He symbolically transcends the limits of terrestrial reality and achieves an existence beyond space and time. In his tale, Poe has fused science and mysticism in the way that critics like Samuel R. Delany regard as characteristic of SF.

AB  - Nadia Khouri. Les Mondes perdus et la revanche du réalisme.-Les récits utopiques décrivant des nations 'perdues', établies dans une Terre creuse ou isolées dans des vallées inaccessibles, ont abondé aux Etats-Unis dans les 25 dernières années du siècle passé. En règle générale, dans une société stagnante où coexistent rituels archaïques et technologie avancée, où d'immenses richesses s'accumulent, intervient une équipe d'explorateurs venus du monde extérieur, qui perturbent l'équilibre de cette utopie ambiguë. L'anachronisme et le mélange des époques et des genres engendrent curieusement l'utopie. L'auteur examine 20 récits appartenant à cette tradition, le premier d'entre eux étant Revi-Lona de Frank Cowan, publié en 1879. Elle rapproche les thèmes constants du genre de l'image que l'Américain moyen a pu se faire du mode de vie de 'consommation ostentatoire' (Veblen) qui fut celui des grands millionnaires américains de la fin du siècle. Le genre du 'Lost World' transpose dans la fiction le prestige de la 'Classe de loisir' et l'admiration ambivalente que commandent les canons de la 'beauté pécuniaire' de la part de l'homme de la rue. Séparé de la société par son mode de vie, le millionnaire devient un être de légende, dont les stéréotypes entrent cependant en contradiction radicale avec les anciens idéaux de démocratie austère, frugale et égalitaire des Pères fondateurs de la République américaine. La prodigalité, l'extravagance, l'accumulation de richesses hétéroclites sont transposés hyperboliquement dans les récits examinés. Cette thématique se combine avec les anciennes idéologies de la Frontière et des pionniers et les rêves de Klondyke, au moment où dans le monde réel ces opportunités d'enrichissement disparaissent. Cette utopie séquestrée n'a pas valeur de modèle: elle est objet de convoitise et son accès est réservé à quelques élus. On assiste à une privatisation de l'utopie, qui est en quelque sorte allégorisée par l'image d'un soleil intérieur brillant au centre de la Terre, mais qui est également exprimée dans l'organisation du pouvoir de ces peuples imaginaires autour d'une figure sacrale, roi, grand-prêtre, princesse. Le tout forme un système implosif construit sur les figures paradoxales de l'antiquité contemporaine, de l'utopie comme convoitise privée, et comme marchandise, et du pouvoir fétichisé. La plupart des récits aboutissent à la désintégration du monde perdu, due en partie à une dégénérescence interne et en partie à l'intervention du héros venu de l'Amérique 'réelle'. En paraphrasant Morris, on peut dire que le genre de l'utopie des mondes perdus exprime un paradis à la Vanderbilt rêvé par un homme du peuple. /// Utopian romances describing 'lost' races established in a hollow Earth or isolated in inaccessible valleys abounded in the US around the turn of the last century. These tales generally feature a team of explorers from the outside world who come into a stagnant society in which immense riches accumulate and where archaic rituals coexist with advanced technology and disturb the equilibrium of that ambiguous utopia, a utopia engendered by anachronism, especially in the form of the mixing of epochs. 20 romances belonging to this tradition (first prefigured in Frank Cowan's Revi-Lona, 1879) are examined in the essay, which assesses the recurring thematic concerns of these fictions as expressive of the image that the 'man in the street' had of 'conspicuous consumption' (à la Veblen) as American millionaires realized it at the fin du siècle. The lost-race utopist thus transposes into fiction the values of the 'leisure class' and his ambivalent bourgeois admiration for its standards of 'pecuniary beauty.' Separated from the rest of society by his style of life, the millionaire becomes a legendary being, stereotypes of whom radically contradict past ideals of democratic austerity, frugal and egalitarian, which the Founding Fathers of the American Republic espoused. The lost-race utopist hyperbolically envisions the prodigality, the extravagance, the accumulation of heteroclite riches of the 'leisure class,' but combines them with the old ideologies of the Frontier and of the pioneers, ideologies rescuscitated by the dream-possibilities opened in the Klondike at a moment when opportunities for becoming rich were in actuality disappearing. Such a sequestered utopia as these writers conceive of has no value as a model: the object of covetousness, it is accessible only to a few elect. It therefore testifies to the privitization of utopia, imaged (and as it were, allegorized) by the emblem of an internal sun shining at the center of the Earth, and likewise expressed in the way the imaginary lost race organizes power around an authoritarian figure (king, arch-priest, princess). The entire form of the implosive system is constructed from the paradox of a 'contemporary antiquity,' from utopia as privatized desire and as commodity, and from fetishized power. These tales for the most part end in the disintegration of the lost world, partly as a result of an internal disintegration, partly as a result of the intervention of the hero(s) from the 'real' America. To paraphrase William Morris, it can be said that the lost-race utopia is 'a Vanderbilt paradise dreamt by a Cockney.'

AB  - La stratégie que les théologiens appliquent ordinairement à leur Principal Sujet n'est pas de celles qui s'offrent à l'écrivain de SF. Le mystère de l'extraterrestre, à la différence du mystère de Dieu, ne peut être préservé par le recours à des contradictions dogmatiquement imposées: ce serait trahir la nature de la science-fiction....La présentation de l'extraterrestre n'est pas sans problème toutefois. Wells, en faisant de ses Martiens des êtres physiquement hideux, les laisse intellectuellement et socialement indéterminés; leurs motifs pour envahir notre planète demeure de trop reconnaissables caricatures de motivations humaines et compromet leur étrangeté. La légion d'imitateurs qui ont repris Wells et cherché à surpasser le 'monstrueux' des Martiens de Guerre des mondes ont réglé les problèmes en privant les Envahisseurs cosmiques de toute motivation intelligible et n'ont produit qu'une sorte de conte de fée inversé au lieu d'une authentique SF. Les frères Strougatsky ont trouvé une excellente manière de s'en tirer qui consiste à ne pas dépeindre les extraterrestres du tout. Pas le moindre aperçu sur les Visiteurs, rien que les résultats concrets de leur passage. Ici, énormément de détails, qui, vus de façon microscopique si l'on peut dire, demeurent tout juste cela: des détails. En ce qui concerne la source et la signification des terribles objets construits à Harmont Zone, on n'en finit pas de théoriser, mais le Dr Pilman favorise une explication ultime: il s'agit des détritus d'un pick-nick extraterrestre au bord de la route. Les 'pillards' qui se livrent à des incursions dans la Zone en vue d'en tirer profit semblent inventés pour discréditer les deux parties dans cette rencontre de deux civilisations. Les humains se conduisent de façon basse et auto-destructive; les Visiteurs ne montrent à l'humanité qu'une indifférence meurtrière. Le récit n'exclut pas la possibilité, qui détruirait la signification suggérée ici: celle que les objets étaient contenus dans un engin d'exploration qui se serait brisé près de notre planète et dont les éléments seraient arrivés sur terre en mauvais état. Cette hypothèse ne correspond pas à l'analogie suggérée par le titre cependant. À cette faiblesse, la façon de conclure des frères S. en ajoute une autre. Avec la quête de la Balle d'Or menée par Arthur et Redrick, le récit s'achève en conte de fée, effet discordant et fâcheux par rapport au reste du livre. De telles faiblesses montrent les difficultés qu'il y a à vouloir préserver le mystère de la SF à travers le déroulement même de l'intrigue et la présentation des événements. /// The strategy theologians apply to their principal subject is not properly available to the writer of SF. The mystery of the Alien, unlike that of God, cannot be preserved by resorting to dogmatically imposed contradictions without betraying the true nature of science fiction. Yet presenting the Alien has its problems. H.G. Wells's approach in making his Martians physically hideous left them mentally and socially unreconstructed; their motives for invading Earth remain recognizable caricatures of human thinking and hence compromise their Otherness. However, the legion of imitators who have debased the example of The War of the Worlds in trying to outdo it in the realm of monstrosity have disposed of that problem by neglecting to furnish their Cosmic Invaders with any motive whatever only to supply themselves with another, by substituting a malign, inverted fairy-tale universe for the real world that SF should model itself after. The best way out of such difficulties lies with the method the Strugatskys adopt in 'Roadside Picnic': of not-depicting the Alien. They never allow us a sight of the Visitors, only the concrete results of their 'landing.' About the latter the authors offer us plenty of details, which viewed microscopically, as it were, remain exactly that: details. Concerning the source and significance of the deadly objects that have constituted themselves as Harmont's Zone there is no end of theorizing; but the explanation finally favored, Dr Pilman's, is the one the title anticipates: that we are dealing with the debris from an Alien roadside picnic. Within the context of such a hypothesis, the Strugatskys' focus on the lives of the 'stalkers,' who make perilous forays into the Zone in pursuit of profit, seems designed to discredit both sides in the meeting of two civilizations. The human beings behave solely in base and self-destructive ways, while the Visitors prove their murderous indifference to humanity. Unfortunately, however, the fiction does not exclude a possibility that undermines this intended meaning: that the objects were contained in a space-probe vehicle which broke apart upon nearing our planet; that consequently raining down on Earth, they arrived in damaged condition. This accident would account in the most economical way for all the 'fictifacts,' but it does not comport with the authors' title analogy. If their oversight in failing to rule out the hypothesis of a 'damaged gift' is one defect of 'Roadside Picnic', the Strugatskys' manner of concluding their narrative is another. With Arthur and Redrick's quest for the Golden Ball, the fiction becomes fairy-tale-like-an unintended effect at odds with the book's overall impression. That so highly commendable an attempt to treat the theme of Cosmic Invasion should suffer from these weaknesses underscores the difficulties to be encountered in trying to carry out the optimal strategy of preserving the SF mystery through the very unfolding and presentation of the fictional events.

AB  - Peter Fitting. De la réalité comme construction idéologique: lecture de cinq romans de Philip K. Dick. - L'auteur centre l'attention sur une scène récurrente dans les fictions de P. K. Dick: la découverte par le héros que ce qu'il prenait pour la réalité phénoménale, en principe, n'était en fait qu'un simulacre mis en place à son intention ou une hallucination qui lui était imposée: scène qui correspond à une certaine catégorie de rêves que nous avons tous pu faire. Cette scène de découverte, dont PF va examiner les formes variables et le rôle dans l'imaginaire dickien en analysant cinq romans (liste à la note 3), correspond à une sorte de critique romanesque de l'idée positiviste que nous pouvons connaître sans médiation le monde objectif: les théoriciens contemporains admettent au contraire que le monde tout autant que le sujet connaissant sont construits socialement comme idéologies. Cependant si nous savons en théorie que la réalité ne nous est pas donnée objectivement et directement, dans la vie de tous les jours notre expérience nous impose inéluctablement le sentiment d'un contact direct avec une réalité naturelle. C'est autour de ces concepts et de ces données que la fiction dickienne se développe. Le monde extérieur comme simulacre construit peut être découvert sous la forme des 'univers objectifs' récessifs présentés dans L'Oeil dans le ciel, de la psychose induite de Time Out of Joint, des expériences massives de drogues hallucinatoires décrites dans Le Dieu venu de centaure, dans la schizophrénie objectivée du héros de A Scanner Darkly, dans la théophanie de Valis, finalement. On voit, surtout à travers les deux derniers textes, dans quelle mesure l'identité est fonction de l'idéologie même. Dick qui proclame 'je n'ai jamais cédé à la réalité', a écrit une oeuvre qui est un éloquent témoignage de la force et de la solitude inhérentes au refus d'accepter la prétendue 'réalité' et à son espoir qui le conduit à rêver la transformation du monde. /// This essay focuses attention on a scene that recurs in the fictions of Dick: the hero's discovery that what he had taken to be reality, phenomenal and empiric, was in fact only a simulacrum put in place at his intention or a hallucination which had imposed on him-a scene corresponding to a certain category of dreams that we have all had. This discovery scene, the variable forms and role of which in the Dickian imagination Peter Fitting presently examines, correlates with a kind of novelistic critique of the positivist idea that we can have unmediated knowledge of the objective world. Contemporary theoreticians, on the contrary, concede that that world, together with the knowing subject, is socially constructed as ideology. Yet while acknowledging in theory that reality is not given to us objectively and directly, we inevitably assume in our everyday experience that we do have direct contact with a natural reality. Around such concepts and such givens the Dickian fiction develops. The external world as simulacrous construct can be discovered under the form of the successive 'subjective universes' presented in Eye in the Sky, in the induced psychosis of Time Out of Joint, in the massive experiences of hallucinogenic drugs depicted in The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, in the objectified schizophrenia of the hero of A Scanner Darkly, and finally in the 'theophany' of Valis. Those last two texts especially reveal in what measure identity itself is a function of ideology. Dick, who proclaims that 'I have never yielded to reality,' has written books which eloquently testify not only to the force and the loneliness inherent in his refusal to accept 'reality,' but also to the hope which leads him to dream of the transformation of the world.

AB  - David Ketterer. Pantropie, polyploïdie et tectogenèse dans les romans de James Blish et de Norman L. Knight. - Un certain intérêt pour l'ingénierie génétique unit les trois romans, The Seedling Stars, Titans' Daughter, et A Torrent of Faces. Dans les quatre récits qui composent TSS, le plus important des ouvrages mentionnés, une technique destinée à adapter l'être humain aux autres mondes est appelée 'pantropie', c'est-à-dire 'transformer tout'. On peut se demander si tout dans un être humain peut être modifié, le résultat est-il encore un être humain? La dichotomie entre le changement et une réalité humaine inchangeable est ambigument médiée par une analogie sexuelle qui se développe dans les deux récits centraux de TSS. Des expériences de 'polyploïdie' ont conduit à la création d'une race persécutée de géants dans TD, oeuvre marquée par une mise en intrigue embrouillée, une psychologie des personnages sommaire et des symbolismes maladroits. AToF, oeuvre de Blish et Knight, présente un procédé appelé 'tectogenèse' et des êtres marins artificiels nommés 'tritons'. L'analyse de la correspondance entre les deux auteurs (aujourd'hui conservée dans le Fonds Blish de la Bibliothèque bodléïenne d'Oxford) révèle la division du travail entre eux, sur une période de 19 ans; ce qui apparaît séparer les thèmes de la surpopulation et de la tectogenèse est réconcilié dans l'oeuvre par les tritons. Les oeuvres de Blish et Knight dans le domaine de la technologie génétique forment médiation entre celles de Wells, Stapledon et Huxley d'une part et celles de Pohl et Varley, de l'autre. /// A concern with genetic engineering links The Seedling Stars, Titans' Daughter, and A Torrent of Faces. In the four stories which make up The Seedling Stars, the most important of these three books, a technique designed to fit human beings to alien worlds is called 'pantropy,' which means 'changing everything.' The question arises, if everything about a human being is, or can be, changed, is the result still a human being? This dichotomy between change and an unchanging human reality or essential truth is ambiguously mediated by a developing sexual analogy which figures in the two central stories, 'The Thing in the Attic' and 'Surface Tension.' Experiments with polyploidy have led to the creation of a persecuted race of giants in Titans' Daughter, a work marred by hokey plotting, poor characterization, and contrived symbolism. A Torrent of Faces, by Blish and Knight, takes over a process called 'tectogenesis' and artificial sea beings called 'Tritons' from Knight's 1940 novella, 'Crisis in Utopia.' An analysis of letters exchanged between the two authors (and now part of the Bodleian Library Blish Papers) reveals the division of labor that went into the novel over a 19-year period. What might appear to be a division between the themes of overpopulation and tectogenesis is shown to be reconciled by the Tritons. Blish's and Knight's work in the area of genetic engineering mediates between that of Wells, Stapledon, and Huxley on the one hand, and that of Pohl and Varley on the other.

La femme idéale dans deux utopies féministes - Les écrivains de SF féministes, tant au tournant du siècle qu'aujourd'hui, ont utilisé le réciţ utopique comme véhicule de leur conception de ce que l'humanité féminine devrait être dans des conditions sociales idéales. En comparant Herland (1915) de Charlotte Perkins Gilman et Motherlines (1978) de Suzy McKee Charnas on peut observer celle des hypothèses sur la nature des femmes qui ont persisté jusqu'à nos jours et celles qui ne l'ont pas fait. Alors que Charnas, représentante d'un féminisme de la fin du XXème siècle, ne partage les thèses de Gilman selon qui les femmes sont, de façon innée, pacifiques, maternelles et asexuées, elle retient cependant, comme Gilman, l'idée que la culture féminine est plus coopératrice, non-hiérarchique et compatissante que celle des hommes. /// Writers of feminist SF have, both at the turn of the century and today, used utopian fiction as a vehicle for their vision of what female human nature would be like under optimal social circumstances. In comparing Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Herland (1915) with Suzy McKee Charnas's Motherlines (1978), we see which feminist assumptions about women's nature have persisted and which have not. While Charnas, representative of late-20th-century feminism, does not share Gilman's assumptions that women are innately peaceable, maternal, and asexual, she does assume, like Gilman, that women's culture is more co-operative, non-hierarchical, and nurturing than men's.

AB  - Anca Vlasopolos. Le Squelette caché de Frankenstein: La psycho-politique de Poppression.-L'intérêt continu qu'on porte à Frankenstein suggère que le roman possède une structure dissimulée qui lui confère sa durable cohérence. La logique cadrée de Frankenstein réside dans le mixage qu'opère Mary Shelley des forces sociopolitiques utilisées pour maintenir en vie l'aristocratie et du drame privé d'un homme qui se voit inéluctablement poussé à l'inceste. La dynamique primaire des actes de Victor Frankenstein réside dans la volonté d'échapper à l'inceste; ses craintes le conduisent à la création du monstre et à l'abandon de son milieu. En raison de son origine artificielle et de son aliénation subséquente de la société, le monstre représente les dépossédés. L'horreur et la cruauté qu'il inspire sont aussi dirigées contre ces personnages qui servent de parallèles et qui, bien que n'étant pas monstrueux initialement, deviennent des victimes lorsqu'ils sont perçus comme monstrueux-c'est-à-dire comme des menaces à l'ordre établi. Le sous-texte de Frankenstein, psychologique et politique, révèle que les monstres sont produits et non pas nés tels. /// Continued interest in Frankenstein suggests that the novel possesses a covert structure that gives it enduring coherence. The hidden logic of Frankenstein rests on Mary Shelley's fusion of the socio-political forces used to ensure the survival of the aristocracy and the private drama of a man who sees himself as ineluctably driven to incest. The principal dynamics of Victor Frankenstein's actions involves incest-avoidance; his fear leads to the creation of the monster and to the demise of his circle. Given his unnatural origins and consequent alienation from society, the monster represents the dispossessed. The abhorrence and cruelty he inspires are also directed against characters who serve as parallels and who, though not initially monstrous, become victims when perceived as monstrous-that is, as threats to the established order. Frankenstein's subtext, psychic and political, reveals that monsters are made, not born.

AB  - La théorie des actes de langage développée par J.L. Austin et J.R. Searle procure un cadre conceptuel pour traiter des relations entre un énoncé et ses conditions d'énonciation. En l'appliquant à la description des dialogues dans La Main gauche de la nuit d'Ursula Le Guin, la théorie nous met en mesure de comprendre comme l'écrivain de SF accomplit deux tâches essentielles: celle d'ériger une barrière linguistique convaincante entre le terrien et l'extraterrestre et celle de faire sentir au lecteur la sorte d'épreuve qui permet de surmonter les barrières de communication. Ces obstacles sont évidents dans la conversation initiale entre Genly Aï et Tibé, laquelle fait apparaître le procès de communication comme une chose susceptible de ruptures, mais aussi capable de charrier des intentions. C'est ici que les théories d'Austin et de Searle affirmant une analogie entre les actes de langage littéraires et spontanés et offrant les notions d'intentionnalité, de force illocutionnaire et d'effet perlocutionnaire, etc., nous permettent d'analyser les causes des erreurs d'interprétation de Genly Aï, mais aussi les motifs et les significations dissimulés dans le discours ambigu de Tibé. Du même coup la théorie peut servir à expliquer comment Genly, plus loin dans le récit, parvient à surmonter les obstacles et à communiquer avec Estraven et à le comprendre. Ainsi, on peut non seulement montrer les problèmes de négligence et de compréhension ultérieur avec vraisemblance; on peut voir également comme le style fonctionne comme un instrument de la thématique. /// Speech-act theory as developed by J.L. Austin and J.R. Searle provides the conceptual means for dealing with the relationship between an utterance and the context in which it is uttered. Adapted to the description of dialogue in Ursula Le Guin's The Left Hand of Darkness (LHD), the theory enables us to comprehend how the SF writer accomplishes two essential tasks: that of erecting convincing linguistic barriers between earthling and alien, and that of achieving a sense of ordeal in overcoming the barriers to communication. The barriers themselves are evident in Genly Ai's initial conversations with Tibe, which exhibit the communication process as something vulnerable to breakdown, but also capable of conveying intentions. Here the Austin-Searle theory, predicating an analogy between literary and natural speech acts and offering concepts of intention, of illocutionary force and perlocutionary effect, and so forth, allows for an analysis of the reasons for Genly's misunderstanding, but also of the motives and meaning behind Tibe's ambiguous speech. By the same token, the theory can be used to explain how Genly, much later on in LHD, manages to surmount the obstacles to communicating with and understanding Estraven. Thus it not only exposes the problems of generating misprision and subsequent comprehension to be those of verisimilitude; it also shows how style becomes the instrument of the theme.

AB  - Le feuilleton télévisé 'Star Trek' semble exprimer des fantasmes mâles conventionnels de la façon la plus direct et la moins subtile. Les personnages féminins, comme dans l'épisode 'Requiem pour Mathusalem', sont des constructions de la rêverie masculine, de la femme-objet, faite pour être aimée puis abandonnée par le Capitaine Kirk. Cela est aussi vrai du film où Ilia, la 'femme nouvelle' a sacrifié sa chevelure (symbole de féminité) pour le bien de sa carrière; elle devient un simple pion dans un processus qui la dépasse et est transformée ainsi en un autre échantillon du 'repos du guerrier'. Toutefois, 'Star Trek' offre aux femmes un modèle de rôle opposé aux mythologies masculines, en la personne du Dr Spock. Celui-ci ne correspond pas aux stéréotypes sexuels qui dominent le feuilleton. Virtuellement dépourvu d'émotions, il peut être vu comme une sorte d''homme-objet'. Il a ainsi conduit certaines femmes à se représenter des rôles qui évoquent le côté masculin de leur personnalité et tendu à les libérer des modèles sexuels imposés par un monde à domination masculine. /// The TV series 'Star Trek' seems to affirm traditional male fantasies in a most direct and unenlightened way. Typically, as in an episode like Requiem for Methusalah, the female characters are constructs of the male imagination, femmes-objets for Captain Kirk to love-and leave. This is also true of 'Star Trek', the Movie, in the course of which Ilia, the 'new woman' who has in effect sacrificed her hair (symbolic of her sexuality) for the sake of her career, becomes the pawn of forces greater than herself and is thus made into one more 'disposable female.' Yet 'Star Trek' does offer women a role-model opposed to the traditional, male-dominated mythology of the sexes: Dr Spock. In the TV series (but not in the film), Spock does not fit in with the sexual stereotyping that otherwise dominates 'Star Trek': virtually devoid of emotion, he can be perceived as a kind of homme-objet. As such, he has inspired women to fantasize for themselves roles which evoke the masculine side of their identity and hence tend toward liberating their consciousness from the sexual models imposed by a male-dominated world.

AB  - Les illustrations de SF peuvent être lues comme des énoncés propositionnels exprimés par un code d'images visuelles. Leur syntaxe peut être fort complexe; l'illustration se combine à des énoncés linguistiques sur les couvertures et, en elles-mêmes, elles peuvent obéir à un principe d'organisation différent du 'réalisme' mimétique. Leur sémantique a aussi ses ramifications qui se peuvent interpréter de fac̦ons variées-comme connexes à un récit donné, comme linéaments d'un récit potentiel, comme marquants de la classe générique du magazine où elles paraissent, comme énoncés relatifs au genre auquel elles appartiennent. La fusée, un des objets les plus communs de ce code illustratif, présente des associations phalliques aussi bien que technologiques qui ouvrent sur un large spectre d'usages et de contenus sémantiques: c'est un bon exemple de la complexité sémantique du code. Une étude approfondie de cette sémiotique devrait apporter des informations utiles pour la sociologie de la SF et la fac̦on dont les amateurs de SF comprennent le système génologique de la littérature populaire. / Illustrations in the SF magazines may be read as propositional statements couched in a code of visual images. Their syntax may be quite complex: the illustrative code is combined with the linguistic code on magazine covers, and by themselves the illustrations can obey principles of organization that depart from mimetic 'realism.' The semantics of the illustrations also has ramifications, since they can be interpreted in various ways-as adjuncts to an actual narrative, as adumbrations of potential narratives, as statements about the generic membership of the magazine in which they appear, and as discourses about the genre to which they belong. The rocketship, one of the most common signs in the illustrative code, has both phallic and technological associations that give it a broad range of usages and semantic contents; it is therefore a good example of the semantic complexity of the code. Close investigation of the semiotics of SF illustration will yield useful information about the sociology of SF and about the way that SF fans understand the generic system of popular literature.

AB  - La fiction de Lem peint l'humanité de deux façons. D'une manière optimiste (Cybériade, Solaris et 'The Mask'), la personnalité humaine, de par sa complexité, est un système difficilement prévisible et autonome. À travers la vision pessimiste, la même entité consciente a le défaut fondamental d'être condamné à l'anéantissement et à demeurer esclave de sa matérialité. À l'instar des penseurs du siècle des lumières, Lem reproche à la Nature d'avoir doté les êtres humains de mortalité et d'animalité. Depuis quelques années le pessimisme de Lem domine son optimisme. Ce changement est illustré dans son catalogue de 'voeux non-exaucés', A Perfect Vacuum (l'écrit qui a inspiré cette première réflexion sur Lem) et par lequel le classique siècle des lumières aurait souhaité une pleine réalisation de l'humain. Ces voeux sont exprimés d'une manière ironique dans un monde caractérisé par l'asbsence d'un dieu qui aurait pu lui donner un sens. Fiasco est l'écrit le plus pessimiste que Lem ait produit. Ce roman délaisse les essais de nature fictive qui caractérisaient son écriture depuis plusieurs années pour se tourner à nouveau vers les aventures spatiales des années soixante. Tout en comportant quelques changements significatifs, l'écrit s'apparente par sa structure à celles de Solaris et à The Invincible qui sont des histoires de rencontre entre humains et extra-terrestres. Fiasco dépeint une certaine cruauté ainsi que l'absence totale de rédemption car le roman rejette l'impression à la fois d'émerveillement et d'excitation positive qui accompagnait ces rencontres. De plus, et pour trancher avec toutes les oeuvres antérieures de Lem, l'intelligence artificielle en présence n'est plus dotée de vertu morale mais manifeste une tendance bureaucratique. La biologie humaine est l'incarnation de la perfidie et la grille freudienne peut être utilisée pour approcher le roman bien que Lem ait rejeté consciemment le freudisme. /// Lem's fiction depicts the 'human element' in two ways. Viewed optimistically (as in The Cyberiad, Solaris, and 'The Mask'), human personality is a system sufficiently complex to be unpredictable and autonomous. Viewed pessimistically, the same system of consciousness is fundamentally flawed, since it is doomed to annihilation and enslaved by its physicality. (The resentment against Nature for creating humankind mortal and animal is something that Lem shares with the 18th-century Enlightenment.) In the past several years, Lem's pessimism has been winning over his optimism, a development exemplified by his catalogue of 'ungranted wishes,' A Perfect Vacuum-the text motivating this first meditation on Lem and one wherein the classical Enlightenment hopes for a full realization of humanness are represented ironically in a human world lacking any meaning-giving God. Fiasco shows us the most pessimistic Lem to appear thus far. With it, he is returning to the space-adventure of the 1960s from his years of writing essayistic fiction. The novel follows the pattern of Solaris's and The Invincible's human-alien contact story, but with some significant changes. Fiasco rejects the sense of wonder and positive excitement of the encounter, for it is a story with a cruel twist and no redemption. Moreover, and in contrast to all of Lem's previous work, the artificial intelligence of the fiction is no longer invested with moral virtue, but instead has a bureaucratic character. The villain is human biology, and the novel can be read along Freudian lines (despite Lem's conscious rejection of Freudianism).

AB  - 'La voix du maître', un des romans les plus complexes et les plus personnels de Lem, dévoile deux aspects de son art. À première vue, c'est un exemple, en SF, 'de polémique', un conte moral. L'histoire du projet de décoder le 'message venu des étoiles' est une analogie réaliste avec la situation actuelle du scientifique compromis par son implication dans l'establishment politico-militaire. L'establishment ne réussit pas à transformer la 'lettre' en arme et pour Hogarth, le protagoniste, ceci signifie qu'elle fut envoyée par une intelligence supérieure apte à séparer la force de vie de celle de mort. Cependant les dernières paroles angoissées de Hogarth semblent indiquer un manque de foi concernant l'éthique sans faille de l'Expéditeur. Bien que la conclusion soit surprenante, elle fait partie d'une intention globale. Lem essaie de résoudre le conflit entre le désordre du réel et 'l'excès d'ordre' de l'art ainsi que d'articuler en une oeuvre fictive la 'philosophie de la chance'. Pour Hogarth, le mathématicien des probabilités, la chance se revêt d'une connotation morale de mort, de destruction et de décomposition. Sa conscience est déchirée entre sa croyance en des explications statistiques et scientifiques et les mystères du soi qui a essayé, pendant toute sa vie, de se libérer du mal. Cependant, Lem n'est pas Hogarth et 'La voix du maître' n'est pas une philosophie de la science mais une de vie. Cette philosophie est celle bien connue de 'l'absurde'. Quand le héros rejette l'absurdité de la chance, il donne voix à l'expression tragique du refus et de l'espoir minimal. /// 'His Master's Voice', one of Lem's most complex and personal fictions, reveals two aspects of Lem's art. On the surface it is an example of SF 'pamphleteering,' a cautionary tale. The tale of the project to decode the 'message from the stars' is a realistic analogy for the situation of the contemporary scientist, compromised by being entangled in the military-political establishment. The inability of this establishment to turn the 'letter' into a weapon indicates to the protagonist, Hogarth, that it was sent by a superior intelligence able to separate the life force from death. Yet Hogarth's agonized concluding words of the novel seem to betray this faith in the Senders' faultless ethics. Although the conclusion is surprising, it is part of a design. Lem attempts to resolve the conflict between reality's lack of order and art's 'excess of order'-and to depict the 'philosophy of chance' in fiction. For Hogarth, a mathematician of probabilities, chance acquires the ethical connotation of death, destruction, and decay. His consciousness is split between his belief in statistical, scientific explanations and the mystery of his own person, which tries throughout his life to liberate him from evil. Lem is not Hogarth, however, and 'His Master's Voice' is not philosophy of science, but a philosophy of life. This philosophy is the familiar one of the 'absurd.' The hero's rejection of the absurdity of chance is a tragic expression of nonacceptance and minimal hope.

AB  - Le roman autobiographique de Lem, 'The High Castle', semble, en apparence, une étude de jeunesse de style réaliste. Il doit être considéré plutôt comme roman philosophique relatant l'histoire d'un enfant talentueux de l'ère technologique qui ressent soudainement une aspiration vers l'idéal. Au début, l'enfant est amoureux des 'petites roues' qu'il trouve sur ses jouets, ainsi que de l'aspect mécanique de la malléabilité de la matière. Il craint le monde imprévisible et illogique des choses vivantes. Pendant ses années scolaires, l'enfant se 'refait' pour s'imbriquer parfaitement dans le moule du système social de l'école. Mais il conserve son individualité à travers sa soif constante pour 'l'absolu', une soif comblée par différentes choses dont une tour dans sa ville (le 'château élevé' du titre) ainsi qu'une terre imaginaire pour laquelle il fabrique des cartes d'identité et des documents. C'est l'obsession pour les documents qui lui fait expérimenter 'la farce tragique de l'existence'. Ceci correspond à la vision adulte que Lem nourrit de l'humanité; elle joue un jeu avec la nature et cette dernière ne pose que les mouvements minimaux requis. De cette façon, l'humanité bénéficie d'une certaine latitude pour pouvoir se développer dans des 'fissures' dont la nature néglige de s'occuper. En même temps, Lem condemne la 'liberté terrible' de la civilisation technologique où la quête remplace la révélation et les cartes d'identité l'absolu. /// Lem's autobiographical novel, 'The High Castle', appears on the surface to be a juvenile memoir in the realistic mode. It must instead be read as a philosophical novel narrating the story of a talented child of the technological era, who suddenly experiences the yearning for ideals. At the outset, the child is enamored of the 'little wheels' of his toys and the mechanical 'malleability of matter.' He fears the unpredictable and illogical world of living things. In his school years, the child 'reconstructs himself' to fit perfectly into the construct of the school's social system. But the child retains individuality through his constant thirst for 'the absolute'-a thirst satisfied by many disparate things, including a tower in his town (the 'high castle' of the title) and an imaginary land for which he produces identity cards and documents. The obsession with documents leads him to experience 'the tragic farce of existence.' This corresponds to Lem's adult view that humanity is playing a game with Nature, in which the latter makes only minimally sufficient moves. Humanity is therefore given a certain freedom to grow in 'crevices' overlooked by nature. At the same time, Lem damns the 'terrifying freedom' of technological civilization, in which the quest replaces revelation and identity cards replace the absolute.

AB  - Stanislaw Lem et Vladimir Nabokov ont montré un intérét constant pour la science aussi bien que pour l'art. Ils affirment l'importance que l'imagination a pour la connaissance: selon Lem, la science de demain peut sembler de la fantaisie aujourd'hui et Nabokov admet que la perception du réel exige l'imagination créatrice. Le rôle de l'imagination dans toute perception signifie que les frontiéres entre l'observateur et ce qui est observé ne sont pas stables car l'imagination de l'observateur fait le lien entre lui et la nature. Ainsi, les frontières entre l'observateur et la nature deviennent fluides et la fluidité se transforme en métaphore importante en rapport avec l'essence de toute perception. Le danger d'une telle force fluide imaginative est de sombrer dans la folie car le réel apparait tellement liquide, que l'imagination des personnages peut transformer toute réalité en un miroir autoréfléchissant. Ainsi, en se rapprochant du monde fluide, ils s'isolent de plus en plus de ce même monde et des autres. L'oeuvre principale de Lem, 'Solaris' et celle de Nabokov, 'Ada ou l'ardeur' traitent de mondes liquides: la planète Solaris avec son océan sensible et le monde dominé par l'eau d'Antiterra. L'océan de Solaris peut s'immiscer dans les pensées les plus profondes de ses observateurs et restituer ces pensées en formes étranges ou bien en copies conformes à leurs souvenirs; sur Antiterra, l'eau est la source principale d'énergie et de communication. Cependant, ces mondes liquides comportent un danger. A mesure que les habitants de Solaris étudient leur planète, ils deviennent de plus en plus hypnotisés par les doubles de leurs propres imaginations produits par l'océan et ils ne contemplent que la réflection de leur esprit. Ils ne peuvent s'empêcher d'investir la planète fluide d'anthropomorphisme, de prendre contact avec elle et de rendre la communication encore plus difficile entre eux. De la même façon, sur Antiterra, les personnages qui ont l'imagination alerte composent le réel fluide à leur propre image. Lem et Nabokov se rapprochent des scientifiques quand ils maintiennent l'importance d'un principe de réalité sur lequel on s'accorde afin d'atteindre un monde de communication valable. Lem soutient que la connaissance de faits scientifiques est essentielle à sa fiction et Nabokov prétend que l'imagination sans la connaissance ne peut que produire de l'art primitif. 'Solaris' et 'Ada ou l'ardeur' présentent des mondes cohérents où certaines hypothèses coincident presque avec le réel, aussi restreint que ce principe peut paraître. Néanmoins, les personnages raisonnables de ces deux romans semblent sains au détriment de la possibilité d'interpréter ce qu'ils voient et d'anticiper l'existence de mondes étrangers. Les personnages peuvent commencer à comprendre la nature ou à découvrir l'amour uniquement quand ils parviennent à un équilibre entre certains principes du réel partagés et la possibilité imaginative de déduire que d'autres mondes existent. Lem et Nabokov se retrouvent dans leur conviction que la science, l'art et l'amour se basent sur un équilibre entre l'imagination et le sentiment du réel. /// Stanislaw Lem and Vladimir Nabokov, having shown a lifelong interest in science as well as art, both recognize the importance of imagination for knowledge: according to Lem, tomorrow's science can seem like fantasy today, and Nabokov acknowledges that the perception of all reality requires creative imagination. The role of imagination in all perception means that the boundaries between the observer and the observed are not fixed because the observer's imagination connects him or her to the natural world. The boundaries between observer and nature thus become fluid, and fluidity becomes an important metaphor for the nature of all perception. The risk of such fluid imaginative strength is insanity because as reality seems most fluid, the characters' imaginations can transform all reality into a self-reflecting mirror. Thus the more they are connected to the fluid world, the more they become isolated from that world and each other. Lem's and Nabokov's major works, 'Solaris' and 'Ada', both deal with fluid worlds-the sentient ocean of the planet Solaris, and the water-dominated world of the planet Antiterra. Solaris's ocean can penetrate the inmost thoughts of its observers and precipitate them out in strange formations or exact replicas of its observers' memories, and water serves as the chief source of power and communications on Antiterra. However, there is danger in these fluid worlds. The more intensively they study Solaris, the more the Solarists become mesmerized by the ocean's replicants of their own imaginations and see mere reflections of their own minds. They cannot escape anthropomorphizing the fluid planet, preventing contact with it, and making communication with each other more difficult. In a similar way, those characters with the most vivid imaginations on Antiterra find themselves remaking reality in their own images. Lem and Nabokov join with scientists in recognizing the importance of some agreed-upon reality principle to make possible a sane world of communication. Lem emphasizes that a knowledge of scientific facts is vital to his fiction, and Nabokov claims that imagination without knowledge can only produce primitive art. In 'Solaris' and 'Ada', we see worlds consistent on their own terms, worlds where certain hypotheses more nearly coincide with reality-however qualified that concept might be. Nevertheless, the rational characters in both novels seem sane at the cost of a crippling inability to interpret what they see and to intuit the nature of foreign worlds. Only when the characters can achieve a tension-filled balance between certain shared principles of reality and the imaginative capacity to infer the existence of other worlds can they begin to understand nature or discover love. Lem and Nabokov thus join in their conviction that science, art, and love all depend upon a balance between imagination and a sense of reality.

AB  - Presque tous les romans de Lem peuvent être considérés comme des textes qui s'autoréfléchissent génériquement. Cependant, 'Futurological Congress' se distingue des autres écrits car il exige ce genre d'interprétation métagénérique si nous désirons le comprendre en entier. Parce qu'il reflète sa propre propension à être un texte de SF, il est peut-être le successeur logique de La machine à explorer le temps. Par son articulation autour du principe de l'extrapolation du moi, le roman de Wells remplit finalement la promesse du titre, c'est-à-dire il est un moyen de faire sortir le lecteur de la prison idéologique ou conceptuelle du moment présent (tel qu'illustré par l'auteur à travers la structure narrative). Également, 'Futurological Congress' est une oeuvre de fiction qui répond à ou qui est dirigée par son titre car elle montre, trait typique de tous ces colloques, une assemblée spécifique à la diffusion de la spéculation prospective. Les épisodes hallucinatoires de Tichy, qui présentent en détail le sujet du Huitième Congrès mondial (les problèmes se rapportant à la surpopulation), sont concomitants avec ses perceptions à l'état d'éveil. Ainsi, par ce moyen choisi parmi d'autres, le texte peut s'articuler à partir de la distinction qu'il évoque principalement: entre le 'réel' ou 'l'actuel' et 'l'hallucinatoire' ou 'l'onirique'. L'absorbtion progressive du 'réel' dans les hallucinations de Tichy contribue à l'élaboration du projet 'actualisant' du 'Futurological Congress'. De plus, ces hallucinations accentuent le processus auto-réfléchissant à partir du moment où elles commencent à se multiplier. Le 'réel' de Tichy, essentiellement lié à l'égout, ré-apparâit enfin quand il prend conscience que l'Utopie de la plénitude du 21ème siècle masque psychiquement et chimiquement l'Anti-utopie de la pénurie. Mais cette découverte, à l'origine provoquée par la prise d'un anti-hallucinogène, l'éconduit au même titre que ses autres hallucinations. Révéler la 'vérité' au sujet de l'an 2039 est un trompe-l'esprit qui une fois de plus brouille la distinction entre la réalité et l'imaginaire. Pour l'essentiel, le processus 'actualisant' a lieu au niveau linguistique grâce aux néologismes qui lient le présent 'réel' du Costa-Ricana à un futur hallucinatoire. Si le lecteur se réfère au discours du Professeur Trottelreiner concernant la 'prospective linguistique', il ne fait aucun doute que cette production de néologismes est une activité consciente. Ainsi, il ne s'agit pas uniquement d'un autre moyen (effectivement le dernier) pour faire éclater la distinction entre le 'réel' et 'l'imaginaire', mais il souligne en fait sinon de fait le principe que la SF partage avec la prospective. 'Futurological Congress' continue (par le biais d'Ubik) le projet de la machine à explorer le temps, c'est-à-dire enquêter sur ses orgines génériques et en développant cet aspect jusqu'aux bases modulaires de la SF au niveau du langage, le roman prolonge les découvertes de Wells pour démontrer l'intuition métagénérique originelle de ce dernier. /// Virtually all of Lem's fictions can be read as generically self-reflexive texts. 'Futurological Congress', however, stands out from the rest of them as demanding that kind of metageneric interpretation if it is to be understood in its integrity. By its self-examination of its own possibility as SF, it is perhaps the logical successor to The Time Machine. The latter, working on a principle of self-extrapolation, is finally what its title announces it to be: a vehicle for transporting the reader out of the ideological, or conceptual, prison of the present moment (dramatized in Wells's frame narrative). 'Futurological Congress' is likewise a fiction which finally lives up to, or is governed by, its title as it presents as the type of all such symposia a particular gathering devoted to venting futurological speculation. As Tichy's hallucinatory episodes elaborate upon the specific topic of the Eighth World Congress (viz., the problems attendant upon overpopulation), they are continuous with his waking perceptions; and in that way, among others, the text operates upon the distinction which it principally invokes: between the 'real,' or 'actual,' and the 'hallucinative,' or 'oneiric.' 'Futurological Congress''s 'actualytic' project is elsewise furthered through the gradual absorption of 'reality' into Tichy's hallucinations. These, moreover, become increasingly self-reflexive once they noticeably begin to generate their successors. Tichy's 'reality'-fundamentally associated with the sewer-does, to be sure, apparently return at last with his seeming realization that the 21st-century Utopia of Plenty psychochemically masks an Anti-Utopia of Scarcity; but that discovery, based as it is on his ingesting of a 'dehallucinide,' turns out to be as delusive as any of his (other) hallucinations. The revelation of the 'truth' about 2039 thus proves to be a trompe-l'esprit, and one which again subverts the distinction between the real and the imaginary. At its most basic, the process of 'actualysis' takes place on a linguistic level, thanks to the neologisms mediating between the 'real' Costa Ricanan present and the hallucinative future. It is unmistakable from Professor Trottelreiner's discourse on 'linguistic futurology' that this neologizing is self-conscious. As such, it not only serves as another means (indeed, the ultimate one) for breaking down the distinction between the 'real' and the 'imaginary'; it also points-in effect if not in fact-to the principle generating this particular text (and perhaps SF generally), a principle which SF shares with futurology. 'Futurological Congress' thus resumes (via Ubik) The Time Machine's project of investigating its generic origins; and pursuing that matter to SF's modular foundations in language, it extends Wells's discoveries in a way that confirms his original metageneric insight.

AB  - La marque caractéristique de l'écriture de Lem est une division étrange entre l'ouverture et la fermeture. Ses essais critiques présentent la littérature comme si elle n'était qu'une enveloppe pour habiller les idées et ces écrits recherchent également la fermeture par un jugement clair qui se justifie rationnellement. Cependant, aux dires de Lem, le peu de planification consciente des idées employées dans sa fiction lui permet d'éprouver le sentiment qu'il ne sait pas ce qui va se passer. Cette division a des racines profondes dans le passé de l'auteur. Quand son enfance abritée et privilégiée fut ébranlée par la deuxième guerre mondiale, il s'est tourné, à l'adolescence, vers la création des textes pour se doter 'du plein pouvoir de l'autorité'. Ainsi l'écriture semble former un trait d'union entre les fermetures sûres de l'enfance et l'ouverture dangereuse mais excitante d'un pays déchiré par la guerre. L'oeuvre critique ainsi que la fiction de Lem témoignent d'une préoccupation cohérente de créer des lieux qui ne sont ni trop ouverts ni trop fermés. Si c'est trop fermé, l'espace étouffe la création; si c'est ouvert sur le vide, la définition en est si vague que la création ne peut pas avoir lieu. Le but est de créer un espace qui est paradoxalement à la fois ouvert et fermé: lieu possible de l'écriture. Afin de créer un tel espace, l'écriture de Lem utilise une dialectique circulaire qui s'applique à englober ouverture et fermeture, chance et nécessité, chaos et ordre. Les espaces richement composés qui en découlent sont observés à travers deux textes types, Cybériade et La voix du maître. En tant qu'oeuvre baroque, Cybériade place au premier plan le surgissement de son langage hors du vide en accentuant sa création ex nihilo. Ensuite des multiples contraintes sont introduites afin de contrôler cet espace et de permettre la production d'un jugement moral. Par contre, le langage de La voix du maître peut être considéré comme un système symbolique référentiel et paraît localiser son sujet dans le réel plutôt que dans le langage. Mais le système fermé du début se développe graduellement jusqu' à ce que le jugement soit tellement contaminé par l'herméneutique que la fermeture est impossible. Les dialectiques de ces deux extrêmes du spectre de l'ouverture et de la fermeture se rencontrent au centre et aboutissent à l'espace caractéristique de l'écriture, un lieu en même temps ouvert et fermé, rationnel et intuitif. /// Lem's writing is characterized by a curious division between closure and openness. His critical essays speak of literature as though it were merely the clothing used to dress up ideas, and seek closure through clear-cut, rationally justified judgment; yet his fiction is written with so little conscious planning of the ideas it will use that it gives him, Lem says, the feeling that he does not know what will happen next. The division has deep roots in Lem's past. When his secure and priviledged childhood was disrupted by World War II, he turned as an adolescent to the invention of texts to give him 'full power of authority.' Writing thus appears to have been a way to mediate between the secure enclosures of childhood and the dangerous but exciting openness of a war-torn country. Both Lem's criticism and his fiction manifest a consistent concern with creating spaces that are neither too open nor too closed. If closed too tightly, the space stifles creation; if open to the void, it is so loosely defined that creation cannot begin. The goal is to create a space which is paradoxically both open and closed, which can then become the space of writing. To create such a space, Lem's employs a circular dialectic that operates to enfold openness into closure, chance into necessity, chaos into order. The richly configured spaces that result I explore through two representative texts, The Cyberiad and His Master's Voice. As a grotesque work, The Cyberiad foregrounds the emergence of its language from the void, emphasizing its creation ex nihilo. It then introduces successive constraints to help control this space and make ethical judgments possible. By contrast, His Master's Voice validates its language as a referential symbol system, appearing to locate its subject in reality rather than in language. But the closed system it begins with is successively opened until judgment has been so contaminated with hermeneutics that closure is impossible. Beginning at opposite ends of the open/closed spectrum, the dialectics of these two texts meet in the middle, resulting in the characteristic space of writing-a space at once open and closed, rational and intuitive.

AB  - L'oeuvre monumentale de Stapledon crée un modèle étonnant pour l'histoire future de l'humanité. C'est dans l'ensemble de l'oeuvre que résident l'originalité et l'importance du roman. Les grandeurs et décadences successives des civilisations humaines sont dépeintes comme des oscillations apériodiques contrôlées par la probabilité et non par une loi immanente de l'évolution historique. Bien qu'il contienne des prophéties technologiques prescientes, le roman, 'Les derniers et les premiers', est supérieur à la plupart des oeuvres de SF qui lui succèdent. Ces oeuvres ne se préoccupent pas des phénomènes sociaux ou de civilisation qui opèrent au niveau des changements matériels et techniques et tout particulièrement des conflits engendrés par ces changements auxquels la civilisation doit se mesurer. La SF a la propension uniquement d'extrapoler les tendances actuelles. La supériorité du roman 'Les derniers et les premiers' est due à la conception qu'a l'auteur d'une humanité vue dans sa totalité; une unité faite d'opposés dont les moyens sont si grands que chaque civilisation ne peut qu'en développer une partie. Stapledon et Borges sont des maîtres de la philosophie fantastique. Mais certains critiques sérieux de littérature ont injustement ignoré Stapledon parce que son roman s'apparente à l'essai et également à cause de la nature fruste de son style. Le roman a de nombreux défauts et la partie la plus faible de l'ensemble réside en la façon dont chaque civilisation humaine est entièrement réduite à son aspect biologique de base laissant ainsi aux facteurs génétique et évolutif de l'humanité le soin de lier les diverses incarnations évolutionnaires. De plus, Stapledon ignore la loi qui affirme que les phénomènes contributifs se développent à un taux exponentiel et que la découverte d'une nouvelle technologie est rapidement suivie de son exploitation. Ainsi, il ne décrit pas les civilisations où la régulation globale du développement technologique est nécessaire afin de contrôler 'l'escalade orgiaque de la technologie'. Bien au contraire, Stapledon considère l'humanité dans l'univers comme un Sisyphe qui, sans arrêt, émerge péniblement du vide pour y replonger à nouveau. Le roman de Stapledon souligne quelques problèmes inhérents à la prophétie prospective. Bien d'innovations sociales et technologiques prédites par Stapledon sur un laps de temps de deux milliards d'années ont déjà vu le jour depuis la publication de son livre. Mais malgré tout il fut incapable d'en apprécier certaines autres. L'importance du roman ne réside pas dans son aspect prophétique mais plutôt dans sa manière rétrospective de peindre, par des paradigmes éthiques et esthétiques, une humanité restée entière. Cette projection de l'histoire est juste car elle affirme l'ouverture du monde et décline la possibilité d'une utopie automatisée aussi bien qu'une chute définitive vers l'hédonisme. Néanmoins, les paradigmes historiquement stables seront de moins en moins utiles pour prédire l'avenir à mesure que la civilisation reçoit des quantités plus grandes d'informations nouvelles. /// Stapledon's monumental novel creates a fantastic model for the future history of humanity. The originality and greatness of the book lie in Stapledon's total design, in which the successive rises and declines of human civilizations are depicted as an aperiodic fluctuation governed by probability, not by an immanent law of historical evolution. Although it is filled with prescient technological predictions, 'Last and First Men' rises far above most works of SF that come after it. Most SF ignores the social-civilizational aspects of material-technical change and especially the dilemmas created for civilization by such changes. SF tends only to extrapolate existing trends. 'Last and First Men''s superiority to most SF ultimately lies in Stapledon's individual conception of humanity as a whole: a unity of opposites whose potentiality is so great that each civilization can realize only a part of it. Stapledon shares with Borges the status of a master of fantastic philosophy. He has been unjustly ignored by serious critics of literature because of the essayistic character of his book and a certain stylistic crudeness. The book has many flaws. The most dubious part of Stapledon's design is the way each human civilization is reduced completely to its bare biological seed, thus allowing only the genetic and evolutionary aspect of humanity to link the various evolutionary incarnations. Further, Stapledon is ignorant of the law that instrumental phenomena grow at an exponential rate, and that the discovery of a technology cannot be long separated from its application. Consequently, he does not describe civilizations in which global regulation of technological development is necessary to control 'techno-orgiastic escalation.' Instead, Stapledon views humanity as a lonely Sisyphus in the universe, constantly emerging from the void with great effort, only to plummet back again each time. Stapledon's book also points out some of the inherent problems of futurological prediction. Stapledon envisions many socio-technical innovations over the span of two billion years which have already been realized in the few decades since the book's publication. At the same time, he was unable to appreciate some others. The book's value is ultimately not predictive, but retrodictive, depicting through ethical and aesthetic paradigms a humanity with all its characteristics intact. This image of human history is correct in that it asserts the openness of the world and denies the possibility of both an automatized utopia and a final decline into hedonism. Even so, finished historical paradigms will become less and less useful for prediction as more and more new information is injected into civilization.

AB  - Souvent dans ses écrits, Roger Zelazny fusionne les mythes de plusieurs cultures avec les siens. Dans quatre oeuvres majeures, Toi l'immortel, 'For a Breath I Tarry', Les culbuteurs de l'enfer et Deus irae, Zelazny emploie son aptitude à créer des mythes et à les amalgamer à l'illustration du thème de la guerre nucléaire. Il présume que son public sait que la guerre nucléaire est inacceptable et ainsi il ne lui est pas nécessaire d'écrire des romans à sensation. Bien que ses oeuvres dépeignent des paysages obligatoirement ravagés et des formes de vie en mutation, elles mettent en scène également des personnages de premier plan qui réussissent dans le monde d'après-guerre. Parce que l'auteur enveloppe souvent ses personnages d'une aura mythique, ils se parent alors d'une stature héroïque. Ainsi, Conrad dans Toi l'immortel est un mélange d'Apollon et de Dionysos et à cause de son parfait équilibre psychologique, il est élu pour gouverner la Terre d'après-guerre. Quand Frost, la machine intelligente de 'For a Breath I Tarry', se transforme en être humain bien longtemps après le suicide atomique perpétré par l'humanité, il devient, métaphoriquement et tout à la fois, un dieu ressuscité, un nouvel Adam et le fondateur mythique des Incas. Hell Tanner, personnage de Les culbuteurs de l'enfer, est un super héros américain qui concrétise les meilleurs et les pires traits de caractères d'un shérif du Far West et d'un Ange de l'Enfer. Ce type d'héroïsme est ce que l'on peut souhaiter de mieux dans le monde dévasté où se situe la narration. Deus irae décrit un monde dans lequel les survivants de la guerre nucléaire créent un nouveau mythe et une nouvelle religion afin d'expliquer la folie qui entraîna la planète dans sa perte. Dans toutes ces oeuvres, Zelazny utilise le mythe dans le but d'explorer et d'exprimer la combinaison magnifique mais dangereuse des éléments psychiques apolliniens et dionysiaques qui engendrent chez les humains à la fois la créativité et l'autodestruction irrationnelle. Les héros doivent trouver des façons positives de vivre avec la détresse produite par la perversité créatrice de leurs ancêtres. Dans Toi l'immortel et dans 'For a Breath I Tarry', le génie équilibré de Conrad et de Frost peut conduire à un nouvel âge d'or. Alors que dans Les culbuteurs de l'enfer et Deus irae, les meilleurs efforts des plus grandes intelligences créatrices ne suffisent pas à assurer la survie de l'espèce. Les explorations mythiques de la menace nucléaire par Zelazny nous livrent un avertissement latent qui pourrait se formuler ainsi: il n'y aura peut-être pas de héros mythique ou populaire assez fort pour nous sauver si nous cédons à nos instincts les plus bas en détruisant le monde. /// Roger Zelazny often writes SF in which he merges the myths of many cultures with myths of his own creation. In four major works-This Immortal, 'For a Breath I Tarry,' 'Damnation Alley,' and Deus Irae-Zelazny applies his flair for myth-making and myth-merging to the subject of nuclear war. He assumes that his audience already knows that nuclear war is unacceptable; hence, he has no need to write sensational shockers. Although his works display the mandatory devastated landscapes and mutated life forms, they also feature vital characters who triumph in the post-war world. Often these characters assume heroic stature because the author wraps them in the mantle of myth. Thus Conrad in This Immortal is a composite of Apollo and Dionysus; he is chosen to rule the post-war Earth because of his perfect psychological balance. When Frost, an intelligent machine of 'For a Breath I Tarry,' becomes a human long after humankind has committed atomic suicide, he is, metaphorically, a risen god, a new Adam, and the mythic founder of the Incas rolled into one. Hell Tanner of 'Damnation Alley' is an American super-hero who embodies the best and worst traits of an Old West sherrif and a Hell's Angel. His brand of heroism is about the best that could be hoped for in the devastated world in which the tale is set. Deus Irae pictures a world in which nuclear war survivors create a new myth and a new religion to explain the folly that ruined the planet. In all of these works, Zelazny uses myth to explore and express the glorious but perilous blend of Apollonian and Dionysian psychic elements that yields in humans both creativity and irrational self-destruction. His heroes must find positive ways to live with the misery caused by the creative perversity of their forebears. In This Immortal and 'For a Breath I Tarry,' the balanced genius of Conrad and Frost may lead to a new Golden Age, while in 'Damnation Alley' and Deus Irae, the best efforts of the most creative minds might not be enough to insure the survival of the race. Implicit in Zelazny's mythic explorations of the nuclear menace is a warning that there may be no mythic or folk hero big enough to save us if we succumb to our baser instincts and blow up the world.

Dans 'Le berceau du chat', Vonnegut se tourne vers la SF dans le but de nous faire arrêter et de nous faire penser à notre problème le plus important et celui dont il semble que nous ayons le plus de difficulté à confronter, c'est-à-dire la possibilité croissante de la guerre nucléaire. Vonnegut se penche sur la vie de Felix Hoenikker, un des 'pères' de la bombe atomique. Hoenikker est un homme profondément et subjectivement 'innocent' mais à cause de son sens perverti du jeu, il demeure absolument inconscient des implications morales de ses découvertes et des objectifs auxquels on les destine. Plutôt qu'une accusation de la science qui tournerait au luddisme, 'Le berceau du chat' nous avertit des conséquences apocalyptiques de ne pas avoir su sauver la science de la technocracie. Ceci peut se produire uniquement si chaque scientifique refuse d'être un complice dans la préparation de l'Armageddon. Le roman nous fait également penser à notre propre complicité. Dans 'Le berceau du chat', le but de la religion bokoniste est de fournir de plus en plus de mensonges aux habitants misérables de San Lorenzo. Conscient de ses responsabilités en tant qu'écrivain de l'ére nucléaire, Vonnegut fournit également à ses lecteurs de plus en plus de mensonges, ou des fictions. Si nous agissons comme si nous pouvons prévenir la guerre nucléaire, nous augmentons nos chances de survie. Malgré qu'il soit peu sûr chez Vonnegut d'éviter notre propre destruction provoquée par notre stupidité et par la déification de la science et de la technologie, ses écrits nous encouragent à résister à la tentation de devenir des victimes passives et consentantes comme l'est Billy Pilgrim, protagoniste pitoyable de Abattoir 5. Tous les Billy Pilgrim au même titre que tous les Felix Hoenikker sont des dangers pour la planète. /// Kurt Vonnegut employs SF to help his readers face problems that they might not otherwise be able to face directly. In 'Cat's Cradle', Vonnegut turns to SF to help us to stop and think about our most important problem, and the one we seem to have the most difficulty confronting: the increasing possibility of nuclear war. Vonnegut examines the life of Felix Hoenikker, one of the 'fathers' of the atomic bomb. A solipsistic and profoundly 'innocent' man, Hoenikker, because of his perverted sense of play, remains utterly oblivious to the moral implications of his discoveries and the purposes for which they are used. Rather than a neo-luddite indictment of science itself, 'Cat's Cradle' is a warning of the apocalyptic consequences of failing to rescue science from technocracy. This can only happen if the individual scientist refuses to be an accomplice in the preparation for Armageddon. The novel also asks us to consider the possibility of our own complicity. In 'Cat's Cradle', the purpose of the Bokonist religion is to provide the miserable inhabitants of San Lorenzo with better and better lies. Conscious of his responsibilities as a writer in a nuclear age, Vonnegut also provides his readers with better and better lies, or fictions. If we act as if we can prevent nuclear war, we increase our chances for survival. Although one finds little optimism in Vonnegut that we can avoid destroying ourselves by our own stupidity and our deification of science and technology, his writing continues to exhort us to resist becoming passive, willing victims like Billy Pilgrim, the pitiful protagonist of Slaughterhouse-Five. The Billy Pilgrims of the world, no less than the Felix Hoenikkers, imperil our planet.

AB  - Miller, dans 'Un cantique pour Leibowitz', explore différentes conceptions de l'histoire. A cause de son attitude incrédule face au mythe biblique et à l'histoire de l'ère post-atomique connue sous le nom de 'Le déluge de flamme', Thon Taddeo représente le point de vue du rationalisme scientifique. La volonté d'effacer toute trace du 'déluge de flamme' dans l'histoire rappelle certains aspects de 1984 de Orwell. L'historien de Miller raconte comment Dieu a exigé la fabrication d'engins de guerre afin d'éprouver l'espèce humaine au 21ème siècle de la même façon qu'il l'avait fait au début de l'humanité. Mais par un trait d'ironie bien placé, la bombe atomique est surnommée 'Lucifer'. L'histoire nucléaire est cyclique et les schèmes de la destruction se répètent sans fin. Pour Miller, la nature humaine et l'histoire se répètent aussi. Ainsi l'anticipation de la destruction de la planète qu'entretient Miller a permis à plusieurs lecteurs de conclure au pessimisme du roman. La désillusion de Miller contraste avec 'l'optimisme historique' qui était en vogue à partir de la fin du 18ème siècle jusqu'au début du 20ème, mais elle sert également de reflet à la 'psychose' de notre époque que l'on pourrait qualifier de 'complexe du nucléaire'. Les explications historiques de ce 'complexe' comportent également une dimension morale: le mal personnel. La fiction de Miller sert aussi d'avertissement. Sa vision historique englobe directement la catastrophe nucléaire et transcende le spectacle immédiat de la tragédie. Comme les prophètes hébreux, Miller superpose l'idée de l'histoire en tant que promesse à celle de l'histoire en tant que jugement. L'exode dans l'espace, dirigé par le Frère Joshua, devient un signe providentiel indiquant que l'espèce humaine ou du moins la planète échappera à l'anéantissement. L'optimisme eschatologique de Miller permet au schème linéaire et providentiel de l'histoire du salut de renverser le schème cyclique et destructif de l'histoire du nucléaire. (La vie de repentir menée par Leibowitz fait partie de ce schème providentiel.) Ainsi pour Miller la répétition est avant tout une 'reconnaissance en avant' en vue de la venue de l''Intégrateur' ou Seigneur de l'histoire qui rétablira la bonne marche des choses. /// In 'A Canticle for Leibowitz', Miller explores various ideas of history. Thon Taddeo, because of his skepticism towards biblical myth and the history of the post-atomic age known as 'The Flame Deluge,' represents the viewpoint of scientific rationalism. The desire to blot out the history of 'The Flame Deluge' recalls certain aspects of Orwell's 1984. Miller's historian recounts how God commanded the making of engines of war in order to test the human race in the 21st century, just as he had done in the beginning. But by a fitting ironic twist, the atomic bomb is nicknamed 'Lucifer.' Nuclear history is cyclical, as the pattern of destruction continually repeats itself. Human nature, as well as history, repeats itself in Miller's view. As a result, Miller's vision of the demise of the planet has led some readers to conclude that his book is a pessimistic one. Miller's disillusionment counterpoints the 'historic optimism' which flourished from the late 18th to the early 20th century; but it also mirrors the 'psychosis' of our time-which could be diagnosed as a 'nuclear complex.' The historical explanations for this 'complex' also have a moral dimension: personal evil. Miller conceives of his fiction as having the purpose of a warning. His historical vision at once embraces nuclear catastrophe and transcends the immediate spectacle of tragedy. Like the Hebrew prophets, Miller superimposes the idea of history as promise on the idea of history as judgment. The space exodus, headed by Brother Joshua, acts as a providential sign that the human race, if not the planet, will go on. Miller's eschatological optimism allows for the linear, providential pattern of salvation history to offset the cyclical, destructive pattern of nuclear history. (Leibowitz's life of repentance forms part of this providential pattern.) For Miller, then, repetition is foremost a 'recollection forward' to the final coming of the 'Integrator,' or Lord of history, who will fit things together again.

AB  - Notre attitude envers nos villes est ambivalente car elles représentent la quintessence de notre culture technologique moderne aussi bien que la décadence, le péché et le délabrement. Bien que nos paroles fassent grand cas du phénomène du 'renouveau urbain', nous préférons recommencer à neuf. La 'guerre' nucléaire viserait d'abord les villes; malgré ses origines horribles, le 'retour à l'état sauvage' qui en résulterait apparaît, dans nos oeuvres de fiction, comme secrètement désirable. Par la fiction nous donnons corps à nos prétentions culturelles sous une forme récupérable. Puisque nous agissons selon des hypothèses, nous devons leur accorder beaucoup d'attention. Quand nous examinons nos oeuvres de fiction, nous nous rendons compte que notre idée de la 'guerre' nucléaire n'a que peu changé depuis les années 30, ensuite que nous anticipons, dans une certaine continuité, la montée et la décadence de l'état-nation à travers le symbolisme de la ville et enfin que nous pensons survivre à cette destruction et même en tirer quelque profit malgré les preuves du contraire. Il est impérieux que nous développions une vue nouvelle et vitale de la paix. /// We hold an ambivalent attitude towards our cities: they represent the epitome of our modern technological culture; they also represent decadence, sin, and decay. We pay lip service to 'urban renewal,' but in practice we seem to prefer starting anew. Nuclear 'war' would strike first at cities. The resulting 'return to the wilderness,' despite its horrifying cause, shows up in our fiction as secretly desirable. Fiction embodies our cultural assumptions in recoverable form. Since we act on our assumptions, they are worth paying attention to. Examining our fiction, we find that our concept of nuclear 'war' has barely changed since the 1930s; that we anticipate a continuing rise and fall of the nation-state as symbolized by the city; that we expect to survive this destruction, and even benefit from it despite all evidence to the contrary. We need to develop a new and vital vision of peace.

AB  - Les obligations morales et sociales des savants atomistes ont été âprement débattues depuis l'époque de Rutherford et particulièrement avant et après le bombardement d'Hiroshima en 1945. Après l'examen des tentatives faites par les savants tels que Einstein et Oppenheimer en vue de rendre la recherche pure plus conciliable avec des applications pratiques au bénéfice de la société, cet article démontre la façon dont plusieurs romans et nouvelles de SF de l'époque (et même avant 1945 dans certains cas) avaient annoncé ce débat et offert leurs propres solutions. Cet article émet l'hypothèse selon laquelle ces histoires contiennent un mouvement qui va du savant 'Superman' au savant fou ou victime et enfin au savant qui n'est qu'un échelon dans une hiérarchie politique et militaire complexe. Tout en reconnaissant que le savant n'est pas seul responsable de la faute, ces dernières histoires impliquent sa responsabilité ainsi que celle de la société en général dans la création de la bombe et la menace permanente qu'elle represente pour la survie de l'humanité. /// The moral and social obligations of the atomic scientists have been a matter of intense debate since the time of Rutherford, and were particularly debated before and after Hiroshima, 1945. After looking at the attempts of scientists like Einstein and Oppenheimer to reconcile pure research with social application, the essay shows how several SF stories and novels of the period (many before 1945) predicted this debate and offered their own solutions. The essay suggests a movement in these stories from the Superman-scientist through the scientist as victim or madman to the scientist as one part of a complex political and military hierarchy. While exonerating the atomic scientist from unique blame, the last stories I consider implicate the scientist and society at large in responsibility for creating and now living with the bomb.

AB  - Puisque la guerre entre les Etats-Unis et l'URSS n'a pas eu lieu pendant les 40 années de l'ère atomique, il semblerait que nous assistions à la réussite de la dissuasion nucléaire. Or, quelques romans de SF tels que The Pallid Giant (1927), Red Alert (1958) et Niveau 7 (1959), dans lesquels la dissuasion échoue, révèlent une logique cachée qui, bien que l'on ait pu croire au bon fonctionnement du dispositif, mène à l'effondrement éventuel de tout système de dissuasion. Le maintient de la dissuasion n'est pas le principal engagement des possesseurs d'armes stratégiques. Il s'agit plutôt de frapper le premier sans avoir à subir des représailles inacceptables et cette politique paraît logique vu le manque de confiance entre les États souverains et le fait que c'est la survie qui est l'enjeu. La progression logique qui va des armes stratégiques à la dissuasion et jusqu'à l'apocalypse peut être désamorcée ainsi que 'Solution Unsatisfactory' de Heinlein en témoigne, mais cela passe par l'abandon des valeurs politiques fondamentales de la civilisation occidentale. A travers la logique classique de la dissuasion, le maintient de la paix nucléaire est toujours subordonné à une logique subtile, plus vaste et inséparable de celle de la dissuasion mais qui tend par la même occasion à la miner. /// Since the US and USSR have not gone to war with each other during the 40 years of the Atomic Era, the logic of nuclear deterrence seems triumphant. However, a few SF novels in which deterrence fails-The Pallid Giant (1927), Red Alert (1958), and Level 7 (1959)-give indications of a hidden logic which promises eventual breakdown of any deterrent system no matter how well it seems to be working. The primary commitment of each possessor of superweapons is not to the maintenance of deterrence, but to the discovery of a way to undertake a first strike without suffering unacceptable retaliation-a logical policy, given the lack of trust among sovereign entities and the fact that survival itself is at stake. The logical progression from superweapons to deterrence to eventual apocalypse can be headed off, as in Heinlein's 'Solution Unsatisfactory,' but only through abandonment of fundamental political values of Western civilization. The maintenance of nuclear peace by the conventional logic of deterrence is always at the mercy of a broader, subtle logic inseparable from deterrence and tending to undermine it.

AB  - Puisque nous avons accès aux forces qui façonnent la matière, nous détenons également les pouvoirs qui nous permettent de contrôler consciemment notre destinée ou bien de détruire toute vie humaine. Depuis le début du capitalisme industriel, la SF a projeté des scénarios comportant cette contradiction ultime entre la liberté et l'aliénation. Apparaissant peu après les visions d'archétypes décelables dans Frankenstein et dans The Last Man de Mary Shelley, la théorie marxiste de l'aliénation endosse une signification profondément nouvelle à la lumière de la guerre technologique moderne telle qu'elle s'est manifestée à travers la guerre de Sécession et la guerre franco-prussienne. Entre 1880 et 1917, quand les écrivains américains se sont appropriés le nouveau genre littéraire populaire dépeignant les guerres du futur-genre faisant partie de la dialectique de la guerre moderne-ils sont devenus les missionnaires du mythe et du culte des armes stratégiques. Ils ont contribué ainsi à créer la matrice culturelle des guerres que livrent les Etats-Unis ainsi que la fâcheuse conjoncture actuelle virtuellement apocalyptique. Pendant ce temps, Edison et Tesla, deux prêtres de ce culte, extrapolaient diverses possibilités de salut par le biais des armes. L'idéologie et la quincaillerie des armes nucléaires sont latentes dans la SF d'avant la Première Guerre mondiale et elle gagnerait en compréhension en se servant d'un nouveau prolongement de la théorie marxiste de l'aliénation. Certaines oeuvres de la SF moderne ont saisi la signification essentielle des forces étrangères que nous avons créées ainsi que notre identité en tant que créateurs des seuls monstres capables de détruire l'espèce humaine. /// Having attained access to the forces that shape matter, we now have powers that could either grant us conscious control over our destiny or extinguish all human life. SF has been projecting scenarios of this ultimate contradiction between freedom and alienation ever since the emergence of industrial capitalism. The Marxist theory of alienation, appearing shortly after Mary Shelley's archetypal visions in Frankenstein and The Last Man, assumes a profoundly new significance when applied to modern technological warfare, which took shape in the US Civil War and the Franco-Prussian War. When the new popular literary genre of fiction imagining future wars, itself part of the dialectic of modern war, was appropriated by American authors between 1880 and 1917, they became missionaries of the myth and cult of the superweapon, thus helping to create the cultural matrix of America's actual wars and our current potentially apocalyptic predicament. Meanwhile, two priests of that cult-Edison and Tesla-were projecting different forms of salvation through weaponry. Both the ideology and the hardware of nuclear weapons were first projected in pre-World-War-One SF, which can be understood most relevantly by a suggested new extension of the Marxist theory of alienation. Some modern SF has penetrated to the essential meaning of the alien forces we have created and of our own identity as creators of the only known monsters capable of annihilating us as a species.

AB  - L'histoire de la SF en Israel se caractérise par des 'poussées' (la première date de la fin des années 50 et jusqu'au début des années 60 et la deuxième de 1978 à 1981) suivies par de brusques déclins. S'interroger sur le comment et le pourquoi de telles situations nous met en présence d'éléments d'un casse-tête sociologique. On pourrait penser que le destin de la SF israélienne est lié à des périodes d'aventurisme militariste ou à la prospérité économique. Cependant, la première proposition est indéfendable et la deuxième n'est qu'une demi-vérité. De plus, ces hypothèses ne tiennent pas compte que la deuxième 'poussée' de SF en Israel, bien plus marquante d'ailleurs que la première, fut accompagnée d'une activité organisée et très répandue de la part des amateurs de SF; ce fait souligne que au-delà de l'économie, les facteurs socio-culturels ont joué un rôle important dans le domaine de la SF israélienne. Notre recherche révèle que la SF et le fandom, en tant que composantes d'une sous-culture, sont les produits d'une quête occasionnée par la désintégration de la vision judéo-chrétienne du monde et par une certaine tendance à la laïcité vérifiable dans la perspective occidentale et prévue par Weber. En partant de ces considérations, la SF est une de ces sous-cultures concrétisées par la recherche d'un système de croyances 'privatisé' à travers lequel l'individu pourrait 'recentraliser' son monde 'personnel'. Israel est un exemple qui confirme cette hypothèse sociologique. A cause de son éthos et de ses structures mythiques, le pays résiste aux tendances pluralistes inhérentes aux sous-cultures définies comme des phénomènes néo-religieux; ainsi la SF est principalement un produit d'importation. Cependant, tout cela s'est déroulé uniquement en présence de conditions économiques favourables (même si parfois elles furent indirectes). Israel est un exemple instructif de par sa singularité (peut-être s'agit-il d'un cas unique); en l'analysant nous pourrions commencer à saisir d'une façon plus générale les conditions socio-culturelles favorables à la SF. /// The history of SF in Israel has been marked by 'booms' (one in the late '50s and early '60s; another in 1978-81) followed by sharp declines. The how's and why's of the matter make for an interesting sociological puzzle. It might be supposed that the fortunes of SF in Israel correlate with periods of military adventurism or economic prosperity; but the first of these possibilities proves to be untenable, while the second is only a part-truth. Furthermore, neither of those hypotheses takes cognizance of the fact that the second, and much more pronounced, of Israel's two SF 'booms' was accompanied by widespread organized fan activity-a fact which in turn suggests that beyond economics, socio-cultural factors have had a significant role on the Israeli SF scene. Here our inquiry reveals that SF and fandom, as they together comprise a subculture, are the twin products of a quest prompted by the disintegration of the Judeo-Christian world-view, by the secularization of that (Western) outlook (predicted by Weber). So regarded, SF is one among many subcultures which have arisen out of the search for a 'privatized' belief-system by which the self might 'recentralize' the-i.e., its 'personal'-world. Israel represents a confirmatory instance of that sociological hypothesis. By reason of its ethos and mythos, the country is resistant to the pluralizing tendency that subcultures as neo-religious phenomena necessarily carry with them, and hence SF has largely come there from abroad. This, however, has happened only when economic conditions have, rather indirectly, created a climate hospitable to its importation. Israel, then, represents a case which is instructive in its very peculiarity (if not uniqueness): by focussing on it, we can begin to understand the socio-cultural conditions favorable to SF at large.

AB  - 'L'Empereur-Dieu de Dune' de Frank Herbert sert de mythe aux intellectuels de l'Occident en les aidant à comprendre, par la biais de la connaissance et des émotions, les contradictions suscitées par la séparation entre le savoir et le pouvoir. Leto II sait et peut; mais malgré le pouvoir absolu et la possibilité de prévoir l'avenir, les actes qu'il pose conduisent à des conséquences imprévues. En comprenant la manière dont Leto se sert de la double contrainte, Herbert amène le lecteur à saisir intellectuellement les risques liés au pouvoir. Rappelant le Grand Inquisiteur de Dostoïevski et le O'Brien de Orwell, les explications de Leto concernant les raisons qui cautionnent ses actes et sa solitude s'apparentent à une forme de séduction qui en appelle aux émotions du lecteur. Le roman de Herbert s'adresse à la présomption et ainsi rend supportable la frustration des intellectuels. /// Frank Herbert's 'God Emperor of Dune' functions as a myth for Western intellectuals in assisting them to understand, both cognitively and emotionally, contradictions brought about by the disjunction between knowledge and power. Leto II enjoys both. Yet even with nearly absolute power and the ability to foresee the future, Leto's actions lead to unintended consequences. Through an understanding of Leto's use of the double-bind, Herbert leads the reader to a cognitive reprise of the risks of power. Reminiscent of Dostoevsky's Grand Inquisitor and Orwell's O'Brien, Leto's explanation of the motives behind his actions and of his loneliness form a kind of seduction that touches the reader's emotions. Herbert's novel addresses hubris and helps make the intellectual's frustration bearable.

AB  - Le premier roman de Tiptree Par delà les murs du monde (1978) ainsi que deux de ses nouvelles 'Love is the Plan, the Plan is Death' (1973) et 'A Momentary Taste of Being' (1975) sont représentatifs de l'optique spécifiquement féministe de son oeuvre et de sa manière de la mettre en scène par le biais d'interactions communautaires et de modifications biologiques. En ce sens, les gamètes humains et les matriarcats mâles qui se retrouvent dans ses narrations en tant que résultats de bouleversements anatomiques spectaculaires attirent particulièrement l'attention. S'interroger sur ces sujets fournit une occasion de montrer comment la SF féministe peut être éclairée par la critique féministe et tout spécialement ici, par la rencontre de Tiptree et Judith Fetterley. En renversant les rôles sexuels (par exemple, les femmes s'adonnent à la paternité) tout en affirmant que l'égalité entre les hommes et les femmes est impossible, les mondes fantastiques de Tiptree contribuent à élucider les relations entre les sexes dans le monde réel. /// Taptree's first novel, Up the Walls of the World (1978), and two of her short stories, 'Love is the Plan, the Plan is Death' (1973) and 'A Momentary Taste of Being' (1975), can be taken as representative of the particular feminist point of view of her fiction generally and of her manner of dramatizing it in terms of communal mergers and biological alterations. What especially merits attention in these regards are the adult human gametes and male matriarchs who figure in her stories as the outcome of fantastic anatomical changes. Considering these matters also provides an occasion for demonstrating how feminist SF can be illuminated by feminist criticism-in this case, through the encounter between Tiptree and Judith Fetterley. By reversing sex roles (in having 'females do the Fathering,' for example) while insisting that equality between men and women is impossible, Tiptree's fantastic worlds serve to clarify relationships between genders in the real world.

AB  - La SF des frères Strougatsky s'inspire du paradigme du conte de fée et les multiples façons d'adapter ou de déformer leur modèle soulignent les différentes étapes de leur carrière. Dans leurs premières oeuvres et aboutissant à L'arc-en-ciel lointain (1963), ils adaptent la version du réalisme socialiste de ce paradigme, telle qu'observée à travers les romans de la 'production', à l'utopisme technocratique de l'intelligentsia scientifique pendant l'ère de la déstalinisation. En 'humanisant' le roman de la 'production' et en remplaçant la lutte de classes par l'aventure des voyages interplanétaires, ils expriment l'enthousiasme de l'establishment scientifique soviétique face aux succès du programme spatial. Après 1964, avec Il est difficile d'être un dieu, l'écriture témoigne d'une déformation problématique du paradigme en se concentrant sur la possibilité que l'humanité ne manifesterait plus le désir d'utopie requis par le monde du conte de fée. Les composantes paradigmatiques du genre sont de plus en plus inversées dans la fiction des Strougatsky pendant les années 60; la fin heureuse semble échapper à l'humanité. Si l'on considère L'escargot sur la pente (1966-68) et The Ugly Swan (1967), cette fin va jusqu'à exclure le genre humain. C'est dans le chef-d'oeuvre sombre Le pique-nique au bord du chemin (1972) que le procédé de l'inversion est le plus marqué. Plus qu'une parodie du genre, nous sommes en présence ici d'un 'méta' conte de fée ou d'un conte de fée ambivalent. Afin de retrouver la Balle d'or, Red Schuhart entreprend une quête qui l'entraînera à travers un monde totalement aliéné où finalement il formulera l'ultime prière/souhait utopique, source de toute l'éthique de l'humanité. Bien que le conte prenne fin au moment où Red prononce son souhait qui rachètera le monde, ce même souhait contient une trace et une possibilité de fin heureuse. /// The Strugatsky brothers have modelled much of their SF on the fairy-tale paradigm, and the phases of their career are clearly articulated by the ways they adapt and deform their model. In their early works, culminating in Far Rainbow (1963), they adapt the socialist realist production novel's version of the paradigm to the technocratic utopianism of the scientific intelligentsia during the period of de-Stalinization. By 'humanizing' the production novel and replacing class struggle with the adventure of space travel, they express the elation of the Soviet scientific establishment at the success of the space program. After 1964, with Hard to be a God, they write more problematic deformations of the fairy-tale paradigm, centering on the possibility that humanity may lack the utopian desire required by the fairy tale's cosmos. In the Strugatsky's fiction of the '60s, the paradigmatic elements of the fairy tale are increasingly inverted, and the happy end seems to recede further and further from humanity. In The Snail on the Slope (1966-68) and The Ugly Swans (1967), the happy ending specifically excludes humanity. The process of inversion culminates in the Strugatskys' dark masterpiece, Roadside Picnic (1972). The novella is more than a parodic fairy tale; it is an ambivalent or 'meta' fairy tale. Red Schuhart's quest for the Golden Ball leads him through a completely alienated world, ultimately to make the desperate utopian wish-prayer that is the source of human ethical value. Although the tale is suspended at the moment of Red's world-redeeming wish, the happy ending persists as a trace and a possibility in that very wish.

AB  - Dans ce roman de 1956, Bester développe sa thématique apocalyptique à travers de nombreuses allusions à toute une série d'œuvres littéraires. Parmi elles, on rencontre surtout la référence au Dédalus de James Joyce et au poème de William Blake 'le Tigre'. Les allusions à Blake sont si nombreuses que le roman de Bester peut être compris comme une interprétation révisionniste, comme une ré-vision, du poème de Blake. L'examen de la thématique du tigre chez Bester conduit à une exégèse blakéenne des conclusions du récit et montre dans quelle mesure les conceptions romantiques de l'imaginaire humaine en déterminent l'action. / In The Stars My Destination (1956), Alfred Bester advances his novel's apocalyptic themes partly through numerous allusions to a variety of literary works. Of these, the most important seem to be the references to James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and to William Blake's poem 'The Tyger.' References to Blake are in fact so pervasive the The Stars might be understood as a revisionary interpretation of 'The Tyger.' An examination of the tiger motif in The Stars leads to a Blakean interpretation of the novel's conclusion and demonstrates the extent to which Romantic assumptions about the human imagination determine the action of Bester's narrative.

AB  - Retracer l'influence de Ruskin sur Stapledon revient à situer celui-ci en tant que critique social moderne. A la suite de Ruskin, Stapledon conteste le capitalisme de laissez-faire, le profit, le vide et l'hypocrisie de la culture bourgeoise, la dégradation du travail salarié concurrentiel, les valeurs d'échange substituées aux valeurs d'usage; il a une dette envers Ruskin dans ses attaques du fétichisme technologique, du progrès matérialiste, de l'esthétique décadente, de la compartimentation du savoir, et du divorce des moyens et des fins. Pour les deux penseurs, la communauté idéale est celle qui réconcilie l'individuel et le collectif. S., comme R., envisagent une communauté socialiste harmonieuse basée sur la 'Loi de l'Aide', mais leur utopisme est tempéré par un pessimisme, le sentiment victorien de la nature basse ou simiesque de l'homme qui l'empêche d'atteindre son but angélique. On peut voir aussi, cependant, de grandes différences entre les deux penseurs; S. rejette l'autoritarisme et la hiérarchie qui caractérisent le socialisme de Ruskin. Son idéalisation du Moyen-âge est perc̦ue par S. comme un paternalisme qui dissimule les conflits de classe. C'est Marx qui probablement sauve ici S. des fantaisies réactionnaires de Ruskin. Moins hostile que Ruskin envers le machinisme, S. pense à une seconde révolution industrielle; il croit qu'une humanité plus sage peut maîtriser la technique à des fins intelligentes. Le but de S. reste celui de Ruskin: étendre aux masses le loisir et le luxe. Influencé par la théorie de la sous-consommation de Ruskin, S. croit peut-être que le capitalisme peut engendrer un niveau adéquat de consommation et restreindre ainsi ses besoins d'expansion destructrice. En conclusion, S. est une figure essentielle de la vaste tradition méconnue que Ruskin a engendrée.

AB  - Ce roman n'est pas seulement une réponse visionnaire à la crise de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale, c'est aussi l'expression la plus directe de l'esthétique politique construite par O.S. dans les années qui suivirent Star Maker. Dans une suite d'essais dans Scrutiny (septembre 1939-juin 1940), O.S. explorait les relations entre l'artiste et la politique; les principes exposés là sous-tendent la technique narrative de Darkness and the Light. On y trouve des éléments de littérature de propagande, de détente, de création, mais le tout est construit comme un antidote à l'évasionnisme politique et au désespoir. La sombre vision de la dégénérescence sociale est un préalable psychologique pour que le lecteur accepte la vision de la 'lumière' comme un scénario de l'avenir à la fois moralement nécessaire et politiquement possible. Le récit est construit de façon à enseigner au lecteur la nature et les obligations d'une citoyenneté mondiale; son esthétique didactique le rapproche de Milton plutôt que de la tradition des utopies laïques.

AB  - L'article attire l'attention sur le type d'héroïsme negatif requis du surhomme John Wainwright et du super-chien Sirius. Cette négativité est fondée dans ce qui sépare John du facteur spirituel qui définit la nature humaine et dans ce qui sépare Sirius qui cherche à se spiritualiser de cette nature même. Ce facteur est évidemment le facteur humain dans d'autres oeuvres, que ce soit le De Divisione naturae de Scot érigène, The Confidence-Man de Melville, les Recherches d'un Chien de Kafka et Les Animaux dénaturés de Vercors. Odd John en atteignant la perfection d''Homo superior' doit reconnaître tragique qu'il sacrifie ce facteur distinctif d''Homo sapiens'. Le chien Sirius avec son encéphale humain appréhende le 'facteur spirituel' mais en reste séparé par ce qui lui reste d'instincts bestiaux. Dans les deux romans, le lecteur est censé s'identifier aux héros négatifs et est conduit à surmonter sa sympathie pour les héros et à se convaincre que tout ce qu'ils représentent doit en fin de compte être rejeté et combattu. Sirius représente la miscégénation perverse d'espèces différentes. Odd John représente la menace d'une espèce supérieure à la nôtre, admirable en capacités et connaissances, mais, à la fac̦on des Houyhnhnms de Swift, autre qu'humaine. L'humanité ne survit que par le facteur spirituel même. Stapledon exprime explicitement le pessimisme courageux d'un humanisme spiritualiste.

AB  - Amelia A. Rutledge. Star Maker: la quête agnostique.-Deux idées, 'communauté' et 'esprit' reviennent avec une grande fréquence dans la SF et dans les essais d'Olaf Stapledon. Alors que le terme de 'communauté' admet une définition constante, celle des conditions sociales idéales pour la paix et la vraie liberté, le terme d''esprit' est plus difficile à définir même s'il semble être une abstraction idéalisée des plus hautes qualités humaines. La quête onirique de Star Maker est une recherche d'un principe au-delà de l'humain, qui validât la vraie communauté. AAR examine Star Maker comme une ironie en progression. Stapledon est résolument ambivalent envers la religion et ne rate pas une occasion de la satiriser. La quête est cependant indubitablement religieuse dans son principe et son but-faire qu'existe la 'communauté'-doit être une 'religion'. D'autre part, Star Maker déplore un schéma d'interrogation, de négation et d'assertion ultime d'un 'Autre' toujours conc̦u sur le mode agnostique, schéma qui se retrouve à travers toute l'oeuvre de Stapledon.

AB  - Curtis C. Smith. Le Manuscrit de Last and First Men: notes pour des variorum-Ce manuscrit conservé à l'Université de Liverpool comporte d'importantes et intéressantes suppressions qui sont restées inédites. CCS décrit et discute quarante-six de ces quelques milliers de suppressions et modifications. Ainsi Stapledon a supprimé un développement sur le Mythe et un autre sur le livre de la Genèse. Au chapitre 4, il a éliminé un épisode où une mère et son fils pratiquent le vol rituel au cours du déclin du premier état mondial. Les changements de style cherchent à conserver au narrateur, le Dernier Homme, un ton constant; l'auteur a cherché à rendre plus généraux les traits de caractère qu'il lui prête. Il a omis certains passages qui auraient rendu infranchissable l'écart entre les Premiers et les Derniers Hommes; et d'autres qui anticipaient sur des données ultérieures. Ainsi le lecteur et les premiers hommes auraient disposé tôt dans le récit d'éléments relatifs à la société et aux pensées des derniers hommes. Il y a enfin des lacunes et des substitutions de pages dans le manuscrit.

AB  - John Huntington. Le Souvenir de choses à venir: techniques narratives dans Last and First Men.-L'aura de profondeur philosophique qui entoure ce premier roman vient autant de la technique narrative que des idées exposées. L'auteur utilise nombre de procédés du type de ceux que G. Genette a observés chez Proust (forme d'anachronies, sommaire et scène, narration singulative et itérative) pour créer une expérience narrative susceptible de rendre sa philosophie de fatalisme extatique. Le jeu qui s'établit entre 'histoire' et 'chronique' (dans le sens de Hayden White) exprime la dialectique qui s'efforce de comprendre l'incompréhensible de l'histoire.

AB  - Robert Branham. Le Mysticisme agnostique de Stapledon.-La fiction de Stapledon se heurte au problème de l'ineffable. Dans ses écrits philosophiques, il prétend que la vision mystique ne peut être rendue par des mots et que chercher à le faire expose à de dangereuses falsifications. Mais en même temps, il croit qu'une telle vision est un besoin pour le développement personnel et social de l'homme. Il résoud cette contradiction en adoptant la perspective paradoxale du 'mysticisme agnostique' selon son expression. Il donne à ses romans visionnaires un style en rapport avec ces convictions. Stapledon cherche à communiquer une certaine intuition de sa vision à travers une immensité d'échelle et des allusions calculées, mais en évitant détails explicites et interprétation. Virtuellement, toutes les images importantes des récits sont expressément mises en question par le narrateur. Mon objectif est d'examiner les motifs, les résultats et les implications du style étonnant de Stapledon.

AB  - Eric S. Rabkin. La fiction composite d'Olaf Stapledon.-Bien que les récits de Stapledon paraissent à première vue extrêmement divers, ils offrent une vision philosophique commune. L'auteur cherche à montrer que cette vision peut être trouvée dans un récit composite fait de quatre des romans de Stapledon. Last and First Men et Star Maker sont des contes astronomiques où le point de vue narratif s'étend à de vastes distances et de longues durées. Sirius et Odd John sont des récits de l'aliénation où la narration doit surmonter les vastes écarts culturels qui séparent Homo sapiens d'autres êtres. La puissance dramatique de ces quatre romans pris ensemble dépend d'une variété de changements de perspective. La vision unifiée qu'ils offrent s'inspire de trois sources: la SF britannique, surtout Mary Shelley et Wells; les discours religieux britanniques et les textes scientifiques de Grande-Bretagne. La science est pour Stapledon, comme pour ses prédécesseurs mentionnés, subordonnée à la fiction et à la philosophie qui informe son univers narratif.

AB  - The contrast of Wells and Zamiatin involves two fundamental models in science fiction. Zamiatin in +Herbert Wells= (1922) eulogized Wells as a modernist writer, and gave voice to his own revolutionary esthetics. Nonetheless, Wells in his scientific romances was no 'modernist,' but an influential adapter of humanistic, Enlightenment narrative forms. In +We= (1920-21), Zamiatin abandoned Wells's reliance on the consciousness of the rational observer, and matched his portrayal of a future society with a futuristic fictional technique. Using a diary-form and a splintered, expressionistic style, Zamiatin revealed the social conflicts of his future State through the medium of its conflicting modes of consciousness and of language. +We= thus transcends the mannerism and formal conventionality of today's SF, exploring the paradox of a form that undertakes to express the increasingly alien. While more recent anti-utopian fiction becomes an appendage of contemporary realism, Wells and Zamiatin wrote future fantasies which, in different ways, go beyond social criticism to a probing of rational epistemological assumptions.

AB  - <xref ref-type='transliteration' rid='trans15'>Les théories de Claude Lévi-Strauss permettent de comprendre le travail du mythe dans 'The Left Hand of Darkness' d'Ursula Le Guin. Selon Lévi-Strauss, les mythes rendent compte de l'expérience sociale, en en surmontant les contradictions par la mise en place d'oppositions et de médiations entre celles-ci. Une telle relation entre mythe et expérience correspond à celle qui existe entre les chapitres de LHD qui sont nettement mythiques et les autres qui peuvent être considérés comme historiques. Le thème que Lévi-Strauss perçoit au coeur du mythe est celui de l'échange entre les hommes, en particulier les relations de parenté. Tel est aussi le thème dominant dans les mythes de LHD. Le mythe de création d'Orgoreyn situe l'origine de la société entre le début et la fin des temps. Lorsque les hommes se constituent en nations - en sociétés - ils se mettent à exister dans le temps, plus précisément 'au milieu du temps.' Une conduite totalement égocentrique, comme celle d'Edonrudath, s'identifie au non-être au commencement et à la fin des temps. 'The place inside the Blizzard' expose la nécessité de l'échange dans une communauté donnée. Deux frères se promettent le 'Kemmering' pour la vie, promesse illégale puisque les relations entre individus de familles différentes sont essentielles pour la construction du réseau complexe d'interrelations et d'obligations qui définit ce qui s'appelle à Gethen le 'Foyer.' Les règles de l'échange social entrent en conflit avec le désir humain de 'se conserver en soi-même.' Un des frères pousse ce désir jusqu'au bout: il se suicide, privant dès lors le groupe de toute possibilité d'échange ultérieur avec lui. L'autre frère maudit le Foyer et prend le chemin de l'exil, mettant en cause le système de dépendance mutuelle entre le Foyer et ses membres. Mais plus tard, il vient à résipiscence. Le mythe vise à montrer que le refus des règles de l'échange amène la mort, soit de l'individu, soit de la communauté, l'échange étant la condition de survie des deux. Un troisième mythe, celui d'Arek d'Estre et de Therem de Stock, explore la logique de l'échange dans le contexte plus large des relations entre communautés. La notion d'échange est illustrée ici de façon positive. Les jeunes héritiers de domaines en guerre se promettent l'échange, se faisant ainsi les médiateurs de la querelle entre leurs pays. Même si Arek est assassiné et, dès lors, les deux héritiers séparés à jamais la rupture entre les deux domaines est surmontée: Therem de Stok donne l'enfant de leur union à Estre. Le titre qu'il portera, Estraven-le-Traitre, symbolise le sacrifice qu'implique tout système d'échange positif entre deux communautés. Un quatrième mythe, 'On Time and Darkness,' décrit le dieu d'Ortoga, Meshe, image de l'échange qui unit les individus entre eux, les réunit en états et intègre les états dans l'Ekumen. Meshe est un idéal mon pas surnaturel mais social. LHD rejette enfin toute version statique de cet idéal, toute tentation d'échapper au temps et a l'histoire. Les mythe de LHD reflètent des normes d'échange qui réapparaissent dans les chapitres 'historiques' du récit. Les mêmes oppositions y apparaissent: froid et chaleur, lumière et obscurité, meurtre et sexualité, homme et femme. Dans les deux cas, les opposés sont définis et puis médiés. Estraven-le-Traitre unit des communautés en guerre en aimant un étranger. Les narrateurs ne sont pas un, mais 'plusieurs qui sont un.' (chap. 1) Dans les deux cas, le règle dominante est celle de l'échange, représentée par l'image du Tisserand. Les mythes instaurent leur signification, non en un lieu hors du temps et de l'espace mais dans l'histoire même où naissent non sans peine et continuellement les idéaux sociaux.</x

AB  - La structure des 'deux Mondes' est une constante de l'œuvre de jeunesse de Wells. Elle est particulièrement apparente dans des récits comme 'The Remarkable Case of Davidson's Eyes,' 'The Plattner Story,' 'The Crystal Egg' et The Wonderful Visit: dans toutes ces fictions, Wells utilise les discordances entre deux mondes à des fins ironiques plutôt que satiriques. La création d'un monde alternatif soulève le problème de l'imposture, thème central que Wells explore dans 'A Deal in Ostriches' et 'Triumph of a Taxidermist' par exemple. Cette structure de mondes opposés lui permet également, dans d'autres récits, de méditer sur les contradictions fondamentales que Wells perçoit dans l'expérience humaine. Dans 'The Flowering of the Strange Orchid,' 'The Stolen Bacillus' et 'The Lord of the Dynamos,' l'opposition prend un tour dynamique et les termes opposés deviennent dès lors ambivalents. Dans 'The Stolen Bacillus,' si le Bactériologiste représente l'ordre face au désordre incarné par l'Anarchiste et les thèmes qui s'y rapportent, il figure également le désordre vis-à-vis de sa femme Minnie (qui passe son temps à faire en sorte qu'il s'habille correctement). Minnie et son bactériologiste d'époux forment ainsi une opposition subsidiaire, inscrite sur le pôle de la civilisation primaire du récit. Dans de telles nouvelles présentant des oppositions à plusieurs degrés avec renversement des valeurs et dans d'autres nouvelles comme 'The Lord of the Dynamos' où les oppositions sont amalgamées, Wells établit les termes antagonistes en tension les uns envers les autres. La tension se ramène à celle entre civilisation et nature, particulièrement en évidence dans 'The Flying Man': dans une image où l'opposition se ramène à une identité on se dirige vers un point de résolution des opposés qui est caractéristique des œuvres les plus achevées de la SF Wellsiene.

AB  - L'étude est centrée sur l'épisode où le Voyageur du temps s'efforce d'arracher sa machine au Sphynx blanc, dans le roman de Wells. Le problème auquel fait face la Voyageur et sa résolution sont lus à la lumière de l'essai de Francis Bacon 'Sphinx: or, Science': l'épisode est perçu comme le paradigme des transformations auxquelles l'esprit humain est soumis lorsque les circonstances obligent à employer le savoir non plus de façon contemplative mais dans la pratique. En décrivant cette modification dans la manière de penser et d'agir que Wells prête à son héros, nous accédons à une meilleure compréhension de la fac̦on dont Wells conçoit la science dans le monde moderne et à une redéfinition du récit de Wells comme 'roman scientifique.'

AB  - Le roman d'O. Stapledon 'Star Maker' (1937) est sans doute une oeuvre de SF inhabituelle, mais elle suit cependant le patron d'autres voyages extraordinaires, tant celui de la Divine comédie que celui des Voyages de Gulliver: le voyage cosmique du narrateur anonyme y est la métaphore du voyage intérieur de découverte spirituelle. Le narrateur traverse le temps et l'espace en quête d'une réponse aux problèmes fondamentaux de l'existence, à savoir si l'existence de l'homme a une signification face à l'immense indifférence du cosmos. Dans la mesure où Stapledon était convaincu que notre vie spirituelle est inséparable de notre milieu social et politique, la quête métaphysique du Faiseur d'Etoiles implique l'explorateur dans l'étude d'autres mondes où la grande tâche de l''éveil' est selon les cas favorisés ou retardés par les institutions sociopolitiques. L'élément satirique du livre offre une transposition cosmique à l'examen de différents aspects de la situation mondiale en 1937 et suggère que le fascisme, la société de classes et l''esprit de troupeau' sont les symptômes d'une volonté obscurantiste qui, à travers le monde de son temps, s'affronte à la volonté de lumières. A la différence de Dante, Stapledon évite la simple alternative du Bien et du Mal et la force créatrice derrière l'univers, le 'Star Maker', n'est pas censée aimer sa création, mais la contemple avec le regard objectif de l'artiste devant son oeuvre. Stapledon conclut que cette attitude critique et ataraxique face à la création ne veut pas dire que la vie humaine est dépourvue de signification, mais que la responsabilité de faire progresser la vie spirituelle appartient à la seule humanité. A cet égard, les conclusions de Stapledon ressemblent à celles de Meursault dans L'Etranger, pour qui 'l'indifférence de l'univers' est condition de sa liberté.

AB  - 'The Inheritors' se rattache au topos de SF du Contact avec des êtres étranges en vue d'explorer les conditions nécessaires a l'interaction sociale. Pour ce faire, Golding dépeint deux sociétés également problématiques, celle des 'Hommes' (les Néanderthaliens) et celle des 'Nouveaux'. Les 'Hommes' ne possèdent rien et dépendent entièrement pour survivre de l'entraide communautaire. Le lecteur est impliqué dans le violent conflit émotionnel qui résulte de la rencontre entre deux groupes expressément définis comme incompatibles l'un avec l'autre; il doit chercher à concevoir une possible intégration. A l'instar de Touami, l'Artiste qui. aux dernières pages du roman, imagine la possiblité de combiner les points forts des deux types de sociétés. le lecteur est invité à concevoir un système social qui soit à la fois riche en produits culturels. tout en préservant la force de la Vie communautaire.

AB  - On a fréquemment critiqué la SF classique, 1° pour son incapacité à représenter des personnages complexes, 2° pour son incapacité à montrer des relations interpersonnelles, particulièrement d'ordre sexuel, 3° pour son incapacité à rendre compte adéquatement du contexte politique, économique et social dans lequel la technologie se développe. L'étude cherchera à montrer que ces trois insuffisances sont nécessairement reliées. La SF de 'l'Âge d'or'-comme diverses études l'ont montré-correspondait à un public d'adolescents de sexe masculin. On peut supposer ici l'intervention d'une censure parentale en ce qui concerne la sexualité et aussi des habitudes de lecture orientées vers la narration d'aventure. Il y a cependant diverses indications du fait que les 'fans' préféraient exclure de leurs lectures le sexe et la représentation de relations personnelles. Une double intolérance, vis à vis du sexe et à l'égard de la prise en considération des problèmes sociaux, caractérise d'ailleurs le milieu scientifique de l'époque. L'intrigue de SF était homologue au modèle du roman de western avec son attitude ambivalente à l'égard de la loi et de l'ordre. Le héros de l'Ouest à la fin du 19e siècle était avant tout un être de violence, séparé de la communauté, dont la soumission à la loi était souvent erratique ou variable d'un récit à un autre. Il évitait de s'engager dans des relations durables ou de s'établir de fac̦on stable en un lieu donné. Le parallèle avec le héros de SF est net: le Kimball Kinnison d'E.E. 'Doc' Smith est incapable de vivre harmonieusement avec son groupe familial ce qui ne l'empêche de jouer le rôle du fier-à-bras de saloon lorsqu'il s'agit de défendre les valeurs de sa civilisation. La mythologie de SF comme celle du Western repose sur un mythos de l'aliénation et de la désintégration sociale plutôt que d'unité communale. Les écrivains de SF voyaient la technologie comme 'premier moteur' de l'histoire humaine et toute critique populaire de l'expansion technique leur paraissait irrationnelle. Cela en a conduit plus d'un à conclure au caractère irrationnel de l'homme du commun et à la nécessité de confier les décisions à une élite de technocrates autoritaires. Cette élite était invitée à contrôler les émotions humaines et les relations psychologiques-conc̦ues comme une affaire de glandes et d'hormones. Cette méfiance face à la conduite des humains non manipulés conduisit divers romanciers à conclure que, dans un monde d'armement atomique. un régime autoritaire s'imposait en attendant le moment où le traitement psychologique permettrait de se passer de toute forme d'interrelations humaines. Sans doute quelques écrivains allèrent à l'encontre de ces thèses générales: aucune genre n'est monolithique: Théodorore Sturgeon dans 'Thunder and Roses' montre le conflit entre valeurs humaines et valeurs technologiques. Le récit ne s'appuie pas moins sur des stéréotypes sexuels banaux. Une autre nouvelle 'Affair with a Green Monkey' montre la nécessité de comprendre les individus et entreprend la satire du héros stéréotypé de l'élite masculine à compétence spécialisée. Judith Merril et Ward Moore ont aussi produit des récits qui montrent le lieu entre l'intérêt pour les relations affectives et celui porté aux structures sociales.

AB  - La terminologie de la critique de SF est ordinairement un emprunt à celle de la littérature canonique, peu apte dès lors à rendre compte de sa position paralittéraire. L'auteur examine l'origine et la portée de certaines formules: 'le sentiment d'émerveillement', 'une littérature d'idées', 'la nouvelle vague', 'cognition et distanciation', 'connaissance et sublimation': il suggère que l'étude des migrations épistémiques de telles formules permet d'en mesurer la pertinence et les dangers, dans la mesure notamment où ces formules emportent avec elles, connotativement, le système d'idées dont elles ont été extraites. Finalement ces formules rendent compte seulement de traits invariants au genre tout entier et tendent à surestimer ces constantes. Revenant sur le critère de 'subjonctivité' de la SF, proposé par lui il y a 12 ans, S.D., qui critique cette notion aujourd'hui, propose de mesurer les contraintes d'interprétation (contrat de lecture) de la SF à des règles génériques, spécifiques à chaque genre. L'auteur défend l'hypothèse que les protocoles de lectures requis définissent plus adéquatement un genre que la liste de certaines constantes rhétoriques par exemple. Sans doute, le lecteur peut-il appliquer tel protocole de lecture à des écrits génériquement divers-la question porte alors sur la valeur enrichissante de l'interprétation produite. La nécessité de produire un protocole de lecture fortement discriminatoire expliquerait pourquoi la SF a évolué, paradoxalement, de récits situés dans un lointain avenir à des récits placés dans un futur proche. Dans cette perspective, l'auteur discute certaines remarques de P. Parrinder rendant compte de ses livres dans SFS de novembre 1979 et montre que des hypothèses axiomatiques déterminent la reconstruction rétrospective de l'histoire d'un genre donné. Il critique les limites des tentatives de définitions intra-génériques immanentes et plaide pour une approche intertextuelle illustrée par The American Shore.

AB  - La SF et l'intérêt qu'elle exprime pour les relations de l'humain avec le non-humain est apparue dans l'histoire à l'occasion du glissement qui s'est opéré d'une conception sacramentelle du cosmos à une conception aliénée, glissement qui s'accomplit au 19e siècle. Le Voyage au centre de la terre de Verne dans lequel les antagonistes sont l'homme d'une part et la nature physique de l'autre, peut être considéré comme le modèle de ces récits où le non-humain et figuré comme existant dans un quelconque 'là-bas'. On peut voir une continuité logique entre les histoires d'exploration de la nature et les récits du contact avec l'extraterrestre, exemplifiés par La Guerre des mondes. Le roman de Wells figure une des façons dont la créature extraterrestre peut être comprise comme une version personnifiée de la nature. Ce roman montre également les difficultés qu'il y a pour tout récit d'imagination à peindre le non-humain: est-il possible de représenter dans la fiction ce qui est radicalement étranger? C'est le problème auquel fait face directement le Solaris de Lem. Ici la cosmologie, centre d'intérêt ordinaires des récits où le non-humain se trouve projeté dans un 'la-bas,' se voit remplacée par l'épistémologie, c'est-à-dire l'exploration des limites inhérentes à tout cadre de référence proprement humain. Il en résulte une fiction hautement consciente d'elle-même, fiction qui est tout autant un travail de critique sur le genre qu'elle est un texte profondément nouveau dans la tradition générique.

AB  - Bien que Zola ne soit pas considéré d'ordinaire comme une des influences subies par H.G. Wells, il existe un certain nombre de ressemblances entre Germinal et la Time Machine, ressemblances qui suggèrent que les deux écrivains avaient certains points en commun pour traiter des conceptions du darwinisme social. La société dépeinte par Zola subit une forme de dégénérescence morale qui résulte de ces conditions d'existence. Une telle dégénérescence peut se comparer à l'évolution régressive à laquelle sont arrivés les Morlocks de Wells. On peut trouver également des analogies chez Zola avec le type d'existence que vivent les Elois. Wells introduit des procédés narratifs qui se distinguent des finalités du roman naturaliste. Mais Zola démontre également que la lutte pour la vie dans une communauté sous-humaine favorise inévitablement l'évolution de l'élément bestial chez l'homme et détermine finalement une régression ultime.

AB  - Les trilogies d'Asimov et d'Herbert ont connu un succès mondial mais, si elles ont été souvent étudiées et critiquées, on a peu cherché à les confronter entre elles. L'analyse montrera qu'il y a là une lacune sérieuse de la part de la critique. L'analogie des structures générales de ces deux oeuvres suggère qu'Herbert a utilisé Asimov comme une de ses sources principales. Dans les deux cas, outre des similarités de détail, on rencontre comme thème dynamique central de l'intrigue un grand mouvement qui va d'un centre-une civilisation en décadence-à une périphérie en voie de régénérescence. On notera également la présence de personnages, psychologues ou chefs mondiaux dotés de préscience et des négociants et des guildes qui remplissent des fonctions remarquablement semblables. Ce qui est plus frappant encore que ces traits parallèles c'est cependant les implications thématiques directement contradictoires des deux trilogies. On sait qu'Herbert a explicitement condamné la vision du monde de 'Fondation' et on peut croire que son oeuvre figure ce rejet délibéré en parodiant les présupposés philosophiques d'Asimov même.

KW  - American literature
AB  - Le roman 'The Left Hand of Darkness' d'Ursula Le Guin dépend pour une grande partie de son efficacité de deux séries d'images en opposition. La série froide (froideur + lumière + blancheur + glace + liquides pâles + main gauche) correspond au yang de la tradition chinoise, la série chaude (chaleur + obscurité + rougeur + terre + sang + main droite) correspond au yin. Les corrélations paradoxales entre lumière et froideur et entre obscurité et chaleur sont effectuées en partie par une invention astronomique: l'orbite et l'inclination axiale de la planète Gethen. Entre ces deux séries d'images, l'opposition est dialectique, comme dans l'œuvre de William Blake, qui avait énoncé le principe selon lequel 'Without Contraries is no progression'. La philosophie de Blake a une grande valeur pour la compréhension de 'The Left Hand of Darkness,' parce qu'elle est une philosophie de l'équilibre des opposés essentiellement pareille au taoïsme de Le Guin; parce qu'aussi le concept blakien de 'Negation' (distinct de 'Contrary') exprime bien l'attitude de Le Guin envers l'état totalitaire d'Orgoreyn: Orgoreyn est la 'Negation', elle n'est pas le 'Contrary' de Karhide. Entre Orgoreyn et Karhide le narrateur et l'auteur ne sont pas neutres, mais au fond en sympathie avec Karhide. Meshé, le fondateur de culte Yomesh qui domine en Orgoreyn, ressemble bien au tyran rationaliste de Blake, Urizen. Le culte Yomesh aussi ressemble fort au christianisme, qui a été considéré récemment comme la racine historique du totalitarisme et de la destruction d'une écologie équilibrée. Le culte Yomesh est une dangereuse hérésie: ses images de lumière s'apparentent aux lampes brillantes d'Orgoreyn et à ses prisons. La lumière totale mène à la tyrannie totale. Le roman n'a pas pour conclusion une vraie intégration des 'Contraires'. Orgoreyn reste une tyrannie rationalisée, et la planète Gethen sera de nouveau perdue par l'Ekumen, si l'on s'en rapporte à un autre conte de Le Guin, 'Winter's King'.

AB  - L'article étudie les raisons pour lesquelles Pynchon et d'autres écrivains contemporains ont prouvé le besoin d'abandonner le réalisme traditionnel afin de demeurer fidèles à certaines vues du 20e siècle, dans la mesure où celui-ci rejette les notions de vérité absolue, d'évidence factuelle, la pensée dichotomique et la croyance dans le potentiel illimité de l'humaine raison. Cette quête des formes littéraires non-réalistes ou bien 'irréalistes' a conduit les écrivains de littérature canonique dans des directions diverses. Pynchon en particulier fait appel à certaines qualités de la SF en vue de méditer sur la condition humaine tout en contournant les contraintes et les contradictions du réalisme. Ce faisant, il pourrait bien ouvrir le chemin à une acceptation plus générale de la SF comme d'une forme narrative valide et acceptable pour la 'haute' littérature.

AB  - Aux Pays-Bas et en Flandre le 'fandom' est né au cours des années cinquante, mais ce n'est que pendant la deuxième moitié des années soixante qu'il s'est pleinement épanoui, quand plus de traductions de la SF anglaise et américaine ont commencé à paraître. Jusqu'en 1980, quelque 750 livres de SF ont paru, mais divers signes indiquent que cette croissance tire à sa fin. Une littérature de SF d'origine proprement néerlandaise et flamande n'existe guère. La plus grande partie de la littérature utopique du 19e et du début du 20e siècles n'a qu'une valeur historique; la très importante nouvelle de F. Bordewijk Blokken ('Blocs', 1931) représente une exception. Après la deuxième guerre mondiale, plusieurs romanciers débutants écrivent parfois des livres de SF, tels Ward Ruyslinck, Hugo Raes et Harry Mulisch. A partir de la fin des années soixante, il semble qu'une tradition de littérature de SF de pure évasion commence à naître; les auteurs les plus notoires dans ce domaine sont le Hollandais Felix Thijssen et le Flamand Eddy Bertin. Il n'y a qu'un seul ouvrage néerlandais de SF à connaître une certaine réputation à l'étranger: Bolland ('Pays sphérique', 1957) de D. Burger, une sorte de suite au célèbre Flatland d'Abbott. La critique littéraire proprement dite ne s'occupe pas ou guère de la popularité actuelle de la SF aux Pays-Bas et en Flandre; trois ouvrages sérieux seulement ont paru sur la SF et la littérature utopique.

AB  - On entend dire de toutes parts que la SF est (devenue) un phénomène international. L'auteur met en doute la thèse selon quoi les idiosyncrasies nationales en SF se seraient effacées devant l'hégémonie du modèle américain. C'est une mode intellectuelle que de voir dans 'la' SF une sorte de mythologie générale du monde industriel. Il prend l'exemple de la SF allemande (1870-1965) et cherchera à y appliquer une méthode socio-historique rigoureuse. On rencontre sous l'Empire (1871-1918) une SF chauvine et militariste organisée autour d'une idéologie raciale germanique réclamant sa 'place au soleil.' Même les romans planétaires comportent un certain degré d'intériorité mêlé d'esprit philistin dont on ne trouve pas l'équivalent ailleurs. Aprés la guerre, on voit la SF 'anticiper' à divers égards sur l'idéologie national-socialiste combinée à un messianisme technologique. Au reste. les intrigues. loin de s'élancer dans le lointain avenir, restent dans la mouvance de problèmes 'nationaux' contemporains. Un début de relations suivies et de traductions entre SF allemande et US apparut dans les dernières années de la République de Weimar. Même après la seconde guerre, dans l'esprit de la guerre froide. on republiera les récits anti-socialistes d'avant. épurés de leurs références nazies trop patentes. Une SF militante, hantée par le Péril Jaune ou par le bolchévisme galactique, tient lieu de substitut aux pulsions militaristes, avant le réarmement. Tous ces traits se maintiennent dans la fameuse série contemporaine de Perry Rhodan. Le racisme. le darwinisme social, le nazisme et la mystique du Chef y subissent une expansion cosmique d'une grande lisibilité idéologique. Comprendre la SF comme phénomène mondial de marché revient d'abord à chercher à situer les diverses topiques nationales.

AB  - L'intrigue et le thème sont remarquablement semblables dans le poème de Byron et le récit d'Asimov. Dans les deux cas, la lumière du soleil s'est éteinte, créant un monde horrible et désolé. L'humanité de qui s'empare la terreur de l'obscurité est conduite à la folie et à l'extinction. Chez Asimov cependant, le cataclysme fait partie d'un processus cyclique. La civilisation et l'équilibre mental réapparaissent à la fin de l'éclipse. Chez Byron au contraire, il n'y a à la fin que la mort et le chaos définitif. Le thème central des deux textes c'est la fragilité de l'équilibre mental des humains et, en fait, de la survie de la race humaine.

AB  - Ecrit au cours des années trente. alors que Wells avait atteint la maturité artistique. 'Star Begotten' adopte la technique narrative du 'cadre éclaté'-en convenant d'appeler ainsi l'emploi de certaines conventions de la fiction littéraire, emploi pervers destiné à frustrer l'attente du lecteur, à attirer l'attention sur ces procédés mêmes. à les montrer comme des artifices et, en fin de compte, à mettre en valeur le texte tout entier en tant qu'artefact autosuffisant: par voie de conséquence, l'expérience de la lecture est perçue alors comme ouverte, éclatée et multiple. En ce sens. 'Star Begotten'. oeuvre structurellement ouverte. représente pour Wells une évolution et un progrés dans la SF et semble tendre vers un modèle idéal du genre. De même que 'Star Begotten' incarne une identité typique et unique à la fois. de même que les personnages représentent une version contemporaine unique de types bibliques. de même le lecteur semble invité à percevoir en lui-même un mélange paradoxal d'individualité et de type social commun. En montrant à ce point la souplesse potentielle du genre (et par implication de sa lecture). 'Star Begotten' a représenté pour Wells une nouvelle espèce de SF. dans le prolongement de ses écrits antérieurs. mais en direction de l'idéal toujours fuyant d'un récit d'ultra SF.

AB  - A titre de continuation de son article antérieur, 'Le Sphinx blanc' (SFS 6:77-84), l'auteur examine la symbolique des couleurs, surtout de la blancheur, dans les récits d'H.G. Wells; cette fois dans l'Homme invisible, et les contes et romans de 1900-1914. La blancheur, comme l'invisibilité, de Griffin, protagoniste de l'Homme invisible, expriment les traits négatifs de son caractère: l'abstraction intellectuelle, l'aliénation, et la mort spirituelle-qui mènent enfin à la mort physique. Mais dans la période 1900-1914, la valeur symbolique de la blancheur en l'oeuvre de Wells est souvent changée du négatif au positif. La blancheur alors est associée avec la hauteur des montagnes neigeuses; elle signifie fréquemment le sublime et la pureté de la vie utopique future.

AB  - Ces écrivains, un couple de l'Allemagne de l'Est, ont commencé à publier en 1955 des récits d'aventure pour la jeunesse. Plus tard quoique touchant à différents genres, de la satire à l'essai, ils vont attirer l'estime de la critique pour divers récits et romans de SF et obtenir un large succès public. Ils ont publié quatre livres de SF depuis 1972: l'Erreur du grand magicien, Formes étranges sur Omega XI, Conviva Ludibundus et des contes recueillis sous le titre le Facteur erroné. (Titres originaux dans le corps du texte.) Le premier livre peut être lu comme un apologue satirique du stalinisme. Le conflit central des autres récits est situé entre un humanisme socialisme critique et la technocratie philistine autosatisfaite. Il y a dans tous ces récits une ironie à la Lem. Le dernier roman des Braun est plus amer que les précédents. Cependant l'horizon d'une morale utopique se maintient à travers tout leur développement, mais les obstacles, à partir de 1978, semblent s'accumuler. L'oeuvre des Braun est dans la filiation, typique de la littérature allemande, des exempla et des paraboles satiriques. qui va de Jean-Paul à Brecht. Les auteurs ont trouvé un ton qui leur est propre, ce qui n'est pas un mince mérite.

AB  - La version publiée par Wells de L'IDM est radicalement différente des premiers brouillons connus de ce récit. Il semble que la lecture de l'ouvrage de Frank Challice Constable. The Curse of Intellect, ait été l'élément qui convainquit Wells de revoir sa première version à la Stevenson. Quelles que soient les similitudes qu'aient pu laisser dans le récit de Wells les influences de Constable. de Jekyll et Hyde et. par dessus tout des Voyages de Gulliver, la version finale de L'IDM est typiquement wellsienne en ce qui concerne surtout l'ambivalence satirique. Jusqu'au moment où Moreau est tué par sa dernière victime, la cible satirique de ce second livre de SF de Wells est ce qu'ailleurs il nomme 'l'homme artificiel' avec son vernis superficiel de moeurs civilisées. Avec la mort de Moreau, ces moeurs et ces façons d'être se révèlent pour ce qu'elles sont, des traits 'civilisateurs.' un fragile bouclier contre la bestialité toujours potentielle de l'être humain. Sans doute, le livre se ferme sur l'espoir que l'homme deviendra quelque jour quelque chose d'autre que ce singe vêtu et jacassant mais à jamais rebelle à tout amendement, tel que Moreau le découvre. L'ambivalence, cependant, ne se trouve jamais pleinement surmontée.

AB  - <xref ref-type='transliteration' rid='trans4'>En dépit de la tendance trés répandue qui fait de la SF un complément significatif de la discipline futurologique, le rapprochement de ces deux activités ne va pas sans poser des problèmes fondamentaux. Les difficultés proviennent en partie de la futurologie même, particulièrement dans son recours à des méthodes quantitatives; pour une autre part, elles proviennent de la contradiction insurmontable qu'il y a à traiter la SF comme présentant une analogie fonctionnelle avec des spéculations futurologiques. C'est ce qui se produit lorsqu'on n'établit pas de distinction entre les modèles logiques, établis par les futurologistes pour organiser leurs données et pour penser l'avenir, et les modèles de théâtralisation propres à la SF, qui donnent forme à l'avenir et procurent au lecteur certains types d'attitudes susceptibles d'informer l'action dans le temps présent. S'il est vrai que la futurologie et la SF ont au moins en commun un statut épistémologique ambigu en ce qui concerne la 'connaissance' de l'avenir, leurs fonctions sociales sont très différentes. Dans les sciences de la nature et dans les sciences humaines, des modèles sont construits pour généraliser, analyser et expliquer à partir de données de l'expérience. Ceux qui voient dans la SF une forme de futurologie conçoivent le genre comme fonctionnant sur des bases analogues. Traiter les textes de SF comme des modèles de connaissance spéculative de l'avenir revient à confondre la fonction sociale du genre avec celle de la science. L'expérience littéraire comporte, certes, une dimension cognitive, mais celle-ci résulte du caractère d'expérience symbolique du fait littéraire et non d'une 'reflexion sur des données d'expérience.' La SF a un caractère figural et non propositionnel. Les formes créées par la SF n'ont pas pour effet essentiel de résoudre des problèmes; elles visent à satisfaire la volonté de savoir, mais aussi le désir, l'imagination, la croyance et le besoin d'agir. La SF promeut une certaine intégration sociale, en confirmant, mettant en cause ou rejetant certains principles sur lesquels l'ordre social actuel est établi et en cherchant à dépasser certaines situations conflictuelles, par la création de formes qui permettent de passer d'une situation à une autre. Ceux qui veulent intégrer la SF à la futurologie ignorent les dimensions rhétoriques et poétologiques de celle-ci pour ne retenir que sa valeur informative. Ils tendent, d'une façon ou d'une autre, à laisser croire que de tels modèles informatifs vont en quelque sorte donner carrière au type d'avenir que l'homme peut désirer. C'est confondre encore la fonction sociale du langage dans les sciences et dans les arts. Un modèle cognitif du futur, même un modèle mécaniste, peut déterminer un champ de motivations. La science, cependant, ne peut que décrire ce qui est et non ce qui devrait être. Ce n'est que là où la production langagière peut servir à satisfaire les exigences de la raison, de l'imagination et de la croyance en créant une dynamique d'intégration sociale, qu'on peut déterminer l'homme à créer un type de futur conforme à ses désirs. Nous donnons forme à notre monde à travers des symboles spaciaux et temporels, produisant une sorte de 'sacralisation' par la fusion de symboles rationnels avec d'autres qui évoquent les grands mystères de la vie, de la mort, du sexe et du pouvoir. L'art seul peut atteindre cet état de fusion. En tant que tel, il peut être un agent de changement social, substituant aux croyances et aux rôles dépassés, des valeurs et des certitudes nouvelles, amenant l'individu à surmonter les contradictions ou à les dépasser. Et la SF est d'autant plus importante ici que son objet est fréquemment le changement lui-même. Il n'en reste pas moins qu'une bonne part de la SF actuelle trahit cette volonté de changement en ne parvenant qu'à peindre un avenir qui demeure substantiellement identique à notre présent.</x

AB  - A 'classic' of modern science fiction, Clarke's 1953 +Childhood's End= represents many virtues and vices of its genre. Weaving together technological extrapolation, utopian and dystopian speculation, e.s.p., and the contact between humans and extraterrestrial intelligences, +Childhood's End= is unified by its elegiac tone, its echoing and expanding image-patterns, and its theme: the next stage of evolution for mankind. The manipulation of mythic symbolism, however, on which Clarke's evocation of the 'sense of wonder' depends, sets up a morality play context, between God and the Devil, which undercuts his explicit emphasis on the powers of reason. The literate reader may also be put off by Clarke's seeming inattention to the means by which a writer must communicate his vision. The style is persistently banal, many individual scenes are inadequate to bear the weight of the 'cosmic viewpoint,' and plot and character are developed sketchily at best. An ambitious effort, it has a high seriousness unusual in pulp fiction, but it barely lives up to its name: +Childhood's End= does not represent a mature stage of science fiction.

AB  - On fera voir trois types possibles de SF au moyen de trois exemples imaginaires. 1. A partir de certaines recherches en cours, un récit sur un système de soutèrement géologique permettant d'empêcher les tremblements de terre. Un tel récit est nécessairement sans ambiguité. les normes et valeurs qui en déterminent la dynamique ne sont pas à mettre en cause. 2. Le gadget-thème est ici un produit chimique permettant de séparer la sensation de plaisir de l'activité sexuelle. On peut imaginer diverses raisons pour sa diffusion. Conséquences: effondrement démographique et inquiétude des gouvernements qui essayent divers moyens de propagande 'incitatrice,' mais en vain. On peut conjecturer sur les crises économiques et morales qui s'ensuivent. De nouveaux canons de la beauté apparaissent déterminés par l'incongruité de toute référence sexuelle désormais. Une certaine conjecture anthropologique s'inscrit dans la conception d'une oeuvre de cette sorte. 3. Un livre de vulgarisation scientifique. dans cent ans, expose en détail les plus 'récentes' théories cosmologiques. L'absence totale de quelque signal 'astrotechnique' que se soit a engendré une crise et requis la production d'une nouvelle image de l'univers. On suppose qu'une première génération stellaire est apparue dans la galaxie (notre soleil appartient à la seconde) où des civilisations planétaires sont entrées dans un jeu de coopération cosmique. ni action militaire ni échange de messages, pour les raisons de distance et de délais. Les Hautes Civilisations, gouvernées par la raison collective se sont groupées ainsi et ont modifié l'univers. L'hypothèse explique l'expansion de l'univers, les pulsars, les quasars comme des faits artificiels déduits de cette stratégie universelle. La multiplicité des modèles mathématiques de l'univers s'explique par le fait que, justement, de multiples modèles construits y ont été testés et appliqués successivement. Le récit no. l est un récit d'aventure technique: il appelle une rhétorique réaliste. Le second peut être traité selon différents modes: réaliste parodique, satirique, grotesque. Les personnages resteront dans la dépendance des canons littéraires. Le troisième exclut au contraire tout appel aux conventions réalistes et aux micro-structures narratives canoniques. De nouvelles méthodes ou conventions sont requises qui tiendront des modèles historiographiques, du collage de fragments discursifs et scientifiques hétérogènes. Il est essentiel de voir que certains récits de SF échappent axiomatiquement aux narrables préconstruits dans l'histoire littéraire. SL passe ensuite en revue certaines hypothèses sur la philosophie des sciences et sur la méthodologie structuraliste. Il fait un parallèle entre la succession des paradigmes scientifiques et la genèse évolutive des espèces vivantes. Là aussi les paradigmes prototypiques déterminent le champ des dérivations possibles. Or, en littérature, il y a cet axiome latent que tous les grands modèles typologiques ont déjà été découverts. à la réflexion. rien n'est plus douteux. La civilisation en créant des problèmes neufs, crée aussi de nouvelles possibilités du narrable et du fictionnel. On peut spéculer là-dessus à partir de formes de déviance ou de marginalité par rapports au stock des récits canoniques: subventions satiriques et comiques, 'anti-stories' à la Twain, narration 'désensibilisée' ou froide. De telles transpositions et déplacements peuvent produire des résultats esthétiques et épistémologiques valables. La littérature n'a pas épuisé les anciens modèles mythiques ou religieux et leurs transgressions possibles. La littérature se nourrit d'interdits et de normes. L'effondrement de tout tabou et l'empirisme pur créent une liberté inconfortable. L'art moderne est à la recherche de 'résistances' en vue de pouvoir les subvertir ou les parodier. Déjà., Don Quichotte opère la collision de la mystique chevaleresque et de la trivialité réaliste. Les prohibitions et les résistances doivent cependant s'imposer à l'artiste de l'extérieur. Il ne peut se les imposer 'gratuitement.' La littérature s'efforce de prouver ce qui est logiquement et empiriquement improbable. Telle est la source de sa polysémie. Une autre possibilité qui demeure est la superposition de structures hétérogènes entrant en dissonance. Le nouveau-roman français a combiné l'effet de surimposition et celui du dénudement sémantique. Les Gommes de Robbe Grillet ou la Maison de rendez-vous illustrent bien ces aspects. Lem mesure la relation écriture lecture qui se détermine dans ces pratiques de l'indétermination et du message 'parasité' de bruits purs.

AB  - In many of his science-fiction stories, Philip José Farmer has dealt with problems of creation, as in 'To Your Scattered Bodies Go,' where all of humanity are revived on some artificial planet by a race of mysterious beings. Rather than deal with resurrection, creation, etc., this secularized religious notion merely serves a pretext for a run-of-the-mill adventure story a meaningless play with various science fiction elements. The writer of these stories is what the 'gods' in them are: a being delighting in descriptions of torture and killing.

AB  - Annotates the content of 113 H. G. Wells's books and pamphlets. They are dealt with as abstract units rather than physical objects, and both omnibus collections and booklets and pamphlets that later appear as chapters or sections of full-size books are ignored. With exception allowed for any work that appears in the Atlantic Edition, early textbooks, or pamphlets to which Wells was merely a contributor, and pamphlets printed for private circulation issued as advertising brochures, or of less than 32 pages are also ignored. The length of each work is given in the pages of the Atlantic Edition or in the abstract pages of the same size. The book-length fictions are classified as novel or romance, and the romances are subclassified as science fiction, fantasy, ruritanian romance, etc. All the short stories and many of the essays are separately annotated, with the stories classified as mundane, science fiction, fantasy etc. The annotations are intended to be factually descriptive as to content and reputation, and are designed to show the intercalations between the various works and both the continuities and the changes in Wells's thought.

AB  - Abstracts the science journalism that Wells wrote before 1900, items abstracted, 60 have been attributed to Wells by G. H. Wells or Gordon Ray, and the remaining 30, mostly from the +Pall Mall Gazette=, have been added after sifting that paper from August 1893 through May 1895 (the inclusive dates of Wells's contributions to it) and checking the results against the cue-sheets preserved in the University of Illinois Wells Archive, Urbana. Taken together, these 90 essays and reviews fall into three types, one dealing with science education and popularization, one with the wonders and mysteries revealed by science, and one with the unorthodox or paradoxical scientific speculations. Interesting in itself, the work as a whole also reveals that Wells's model of what good science writing should be closely parallels the methods that he transposed to the fictional frame of science short stories and scientific romances.

AB  - A reading of +Starship= which discloses abrupt shifts in 'generic expectations' suggests that this form, a collage of successive and relatively unrelated types of narrative, may be a privileged one for science fiction and may provide a more adequate way of defining the latter's structure than the older opposition between realism and fantasy. At the same time, in Aldiss' book, the structure (the author's rapid shifts in genre) is projected onto the axis of content in the form of the theme of manipulation, and the final generic twist in Aldiss' work reveals the underlying political basis of the novel, which would appear to express a repressed anxiety about the relationship of advanced countries to underdeveloped ones.

AB  - In response to Blish's claim that science fiction is the literature of change and thus has the function of making its readers better able to face the future, Rottensteiner argues that English-language science fiction serves no such function in any realistic way, since it ignores Marxism, the science of change and the official philosophy of millions of the world's inhabitants. Blish, while citing some exceptions, accepts the general truth of the charge of ignoring Marxism, most science-fiction writers being antipathetic to official philosophies of any kind. Le Guin, while sympathetic to Rottensteiner's position, deplores the tone of his attack, fearing that it points toward closed rather than open universes. Franklin charges that most American and English science-fiction writers have not only ignored but actively opposed Marxism and given full support to Western imperialism. Davis, speaking as an American science-fiction writer influenced by Marxism, grants that he and his fellow writers have tended to pose social concepts rather than to confront them, and thus to be trivial rather than serious, but warns against official doctrines: "Governmental apologetics are not always false, but they are always one-sided."
